<h2 class="p4">Foreword</h2>

<p class="p2">With the unprecedented increase in our commercial
activities has come a demand for better business
methods. Methods which were adequate for the
business of a less active commercial era, have given way to
systems and labor-saving ideas in keeping with the financial
and industrial progress of the world.</p>

<p>Out of this progress has risen a new literature&mdash;the
literature of business. But with the rapid advancement in
the science of business, its literature can scarcely be said to
have kept pace, at least, not to the same extent as in other
sciences and professions. Much excellent material dealing
with special phases of business activity has been prepared,
but this is so scattered that the student desiring to acquire
a comprehensive business library has found himself confronted
by serious difficulties. He has been obliged, to a great extent,
to make his selections blindly, resulting in many duplications
of material without securing needed information on important
phases of the subject.</p>

<p>In the belief that a demand exists for a library which
shall embrace the best practice in all branches of business&mdash;from
buying to selling, from simple bookkeeping to the
administration of the financial affairs of a great corporation&mdash;these
volumes have been prepared. Prepared primarily for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
use as instruction books for the American School of Correspondence,
the material from which the Cyclopedia has been
compiled embraces the latest ideas with explanations of the
most approved methods of modern business.</p>

<p>Editors and writers have been selected because of their
familiarity with, and experience in handling various subjects
pertaining to Commerce, Accountancy, and Business Administration.
Writers with practical business experience have
received preference over those with theoretical training;
practicability has been considered of greater importance than
literary excellence.</p>

<p>In addition to covering the entire general field of business,
this Cyclopedia contains much specialized information not
heretofore published in any form. This specialization is particularly
apparent in those sections which treat of accounting
and methods of management for Department Stores, Contractors,
Publishers and Printers, Insurance, and Real Estate.
The value of this information will be recognized by every
student of business.</p>

<p>The principal value which is claimed for this Cyclopedia
is as a reference work, but, comprising as it does the material
used by the School in its correspondence courses, it is offered
with the confident expectation that it will prove of great
value to the trained man who desires to become conversant
with phases of business practice with which he is unfamiliar,
and to those holding advanced clerical and managerial
positions.</p>

<p>In conclusion, grateful acknowledgment is made to authors
and collaborators, to whose hearty cooperation the excellence
of this work is due.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THEORY OF ACCOUNTS</h2>

<h3 class="p2">PART I</h3>

<p class="p1">Like every other special branch of study, the Theory and Practice
of Accounts has its own special vocabulary of technical terms.

thoroughly with their use.</p>

<p class="ph">DEFINITION AND OBJECTS OF BOOKKEEPING</p>

<p>1. Bookkeeping is the art of recording the transactions of a
business in a manner that makes it possible to determine the accuracy
of the records.</p>

<p>The objects of bookkeeping are:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">(<i>a</i>) To exhibit a record of the separate transactions of a business.</p>

<p class="pbq">(<i>b</i>) To furnish statistical information in respect to any particular class
of transactions.</p>

<p class="pbq">(<i>c</i>) To exhibit the financial standing or condition of a business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">When properly assembled the bookkeeping records become
<i>accounts</i> (for definition, see Dictionary of Commercial Terms).</p>

<p>If correct methods are used, the bookkeeping records will be
assembled or grouped in a manner to show their exact nature and their
bearing on the status of the business, or the standing of the account.</p>

<p><b>2. Debit.</b> The term <i>debit</i> designates those items in an account
representing values with which we have parted, or transferred to
another person or account. Debits are always placed on the left side
(or in the left-hand column) of an account. Debits to persons are of
the following classes:</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">(<i>a</i>) The transfer of merchandise.<br />

(<i>b</i>) The rendering of services.<br/>

(<i>c</i>) The use of something of value.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Examples</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) We sell to John Doe two tons of coal at $7.50 per ton. We
<i>debit</i> his account with the amount.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) We render services to Thos. Ryan for which he is to pay us
a stated fee. We <i>debit</i> his account with the amount of the fee.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) We are to pay rent for the use of our offices. Our landlord
<i>debits</i> us with the amount.</p>

<p><b>3. Credit.</b> The term <i>credit</i> designates those items in an account
representing value which we have received or which has been transferred
to us. Credits are always placed on the right side (or in the
right-hand column) of an account. Credits to persons are of the
following classes:</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">(<i>a</i>) The receipt of merchandise or money.<br />

(<i>b</i>) The rendering of services.<br />

(<i>c</i>) The use of something of value.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Examples</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) John Doe pays us $10.00 on account. We <i>credit</i> his account
with the amount.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Our attorney makes a charge for legal services. We <i>credit</i>
his account with the amount.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) We rent or lease property to another; and when payment
is made, we <i>credit</i> his account.</p>

<p><b>4. Rules for Debit and Credit.</b> Debit and credit are the fundamental
principles of bookkeeping. The general rules to be followed
in debits and credits are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbqn p1">Debit cash when you receive it.<br />
Debit a person when you trust him.<br />
Debit a person when you pay him.<br />
Credit cash when you pay it out.<br />
Credit a person when he trusts you.<br />
Credit a person when he pays you.</p><br />

<p class="b1"><b>5. Balance.</b> When the two sides of an account differ in amount,
it is said to show a balance. If the debit side of the account is the
larger, the difference is a <i>debit balance</i>. If the credit side of the
account is the larger, the difference is a <i>credit balance</i>.</p>

<p><i>Example</i>&mdash;If we debit John Doe's account for two tons of coal
at $7.50 a ton, or $15.00 (see Example (<i>a</i>), Article 2), and credit his
account with $10.00 paid (see Example (<i>a</i>), Article 3), the debit side
of the account is $5.00 greater than the credit side. Therefore it
shows a debit balance.</p>

<p class="ph">METHODS OF BOOKKEEPING</p>

<p>6. There are but two methods or systems of bookkeeping, and
they are known as <i>single entry</i> and <i>double entry</i>. No matter in what
form bookkeeping records are kept, the method must be either single
or double entry.</p>

<p>Single entry is used only in very small businesses or by those who
do not understand the advantages of double entry.</p>

<p class="ph">SINGLE ENTRY</p>

<p>7. As the name indicates, single entry is a single record of the
transaction&mdash;that is, a record of one phase of the transaction only.</p>

<p><i>Example</i>&mdash;John Doe's account would show that he received two
tons of coal, but there would be no corresponding account to show
that our supply of coal had been diminished.</p>

<p>Single entry fails to fulfil the object of bookkeeping, as it does
not exhibit the true financial condition of the business, and is incapable
of proof of accuracy.</p>

<p class="ph">DOUBLE ENTRY</p>

<p>8. Double entry is a system of making two entries (or a double
record) of every transaction. In every business transaction, two distinct
factors are involved&mdash;namely, that which is received, and that
which is parted with. If we sell a given quantity of a commodity,
we part with it, and the sale takes from or decreases the value of that
particular commodity in our possession. If we sell for cash, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
transaction adds to our cash possessions; while if the value of the commodity
is debited or charged to the account of a customer, it adds to
the amount we are to receive from that customer.</p>

<p><b>9. Principle of Double Entry.</b> Double entry is a system of
debits and credits. One writer expresses it as a system of opposing
contra things.</p>

<p><i>The fundamental principle of double entry is that there must be a
corresponding credit for every debit.</i></p>

<p><i>Example</i>&mdash;When we sell John Doe two tons of coal, we debit
his account; but we have decreased the value of our stock of coal, and
to complete the double entry, we credit coal account (or <i>Merchandise</i>,
as the account representing our stock in trade is sometimes known).
When he pays us money, we credit his account, and debit cash.</p>

<p><b>10. Advantages of Double Entry.</b> The principal advantages
of double entry bookkeeping are that the system permits of making
an accurate exhibit of the standing of the business; it exhibits the profits
and losses; it shows the sources of profits and the causes of losses;
it permits of proof of the accuracy of the records.</p>

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>11. <i>Account books</i> are ruled with special forms which adapt them
to bookkeeping records. The forms of ruling are many and varied to
suit the requirements of different classes of business. Rulings for
double entry bookkeeping do not differ materially from those used in
single entry. For double entry, at least two amount columns must be
provided&mdash;one for debits, and one for credits.</p>

<p>The most common form of ruling is known as <i>journal ruling</i>.
A book with this ruling is also known as a <i>journal ledger</i>.</p>

<p>The words in parentheses explain the purpose of the different
columns. The abbreviations <i>Dr.</i> (debit) and <i>Cr.</i> (credit) are sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
written at the head of the amount column; but most bookkeepers
omit them, as the position of the columns indicates their
purpose.</p>

<p class="ph">DEMONSTRATION</p>

<p>To illustrate the manner of entering transactions in accounts, we
show in the accompanying diagrams how the transactions used in
the foregoing examples would appear in the proper accounts.</p>

<p class="ph">EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE</p>

write up the account of John Doe as per example given in
Articles 2 and 3.</p>

<p>2. Write up the account of John Doe, showing also the accounts
necessary to complete the double entry, as per example in Article 11.</p>

<p>3. Write up the accounts covering the following transactions,
by the single entry method:</p>

<p>Nov. 16. Sold to James Stevenson 4 cords of wood, at $4.75 per
cord. Sold to Andrew White 2½ tons of coal, at $6.00 a ton.</p>

<p>Nov. 17. Sold to Wm. Johnson 1 ton of coal, at $7.00 a ton.</p>

<p>Nov. 19. Received from James Stevenson $12.00 cash, to apply
on account.</p>

<p>Nov. 20. Received from Wm. Johnson $7.00 in payment of
account.</p>

<p>4. Write up the same accounts by the double entry method,
using a merchandise account to represent all classes of merchandise
sold.</p>

<p class="ph">CLASSES OF ACCOUNT BOOKS</p>

<p>12. Account books are of two classes: (<i>a</i>) those in which complete
records of transactions, or complete accounts, are kept; (<i>b</i>) those
which contain particulars of individual transactions which must afterward
be transferred to books of the (<i>a</i>) class.</p>

<p>Books of the (<i>a</i>) class are known as <i>principal books</i> or <i>books of
record</i>; that is, they contain the final or permanent record of an account.</p>

<p>Books of the (<i>b</i>) class are of two kinds: (<i>ba</i>) books of <i>original
entry</i>; (<i>bb</i>) <i>auxiliary books</i>.</p>

<p>Any book which contains the first (or original) record of a transaction
is a book of original entry (<i>ba</i>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">A CORNER IN THE OFFICES OF THE PLATT IRON WORKS, DAYTON, OHIO</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Any book in which records contained in books of original entry
(<i>ba</i>) are assembled, to be transferred later to principal books (<i>a</i>), is an
auxiliary book.</p>

<p>Any book used for the purpose of assembling statistical information
is an auxiliary book.</p>

<p>The books most commonly used in double entry bookkeeping are:
<i>Order Book</i>, <i>Day Book</i>, <i>Cash Book</i>, <i>Journal</i>, <i>Sales Book</i>, <i>Purchase
Book</i>, <i>Ledger</i>.</p>

<p><b>13. Order Book.</b> An Order Book is a book of original entry in
which is entered a record of each order or request for the shipment or
delivery of merchandise. The record shows the name and address of
the customer, the kinds and quantities of goods wanted, and the prices
at which they are to be sold.</p>

<p>The ruling of the order book varies according to the nature of the
business. A simple form of ruling is shown.</p>

<p><b>14. Day Book.</b> A Day Book is a book of original entry in
which are entered full particulars of each completed transaction.
These records are afterwards assembled in auxiliary books, from
which they are transferred to the principal books.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-050.jpg" width="400" height="138"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The use of the day book was formerly universal, but it has been
discarded by modern bookkeepers as its use involves unnecessary
labor. The records formerly kept in the day book are now made
directly in certain books then known as auxiliary, which makes of
them books of original entry. The ruling of the day book is shown.</p>

<p><b>15. Cash Book.</b> A Cash Book is a book of original entry containing
records of all transactions which involve either the receipt or
payment of cash. The records in the cash book are in fact a complete
account with cash. We debit cash for all money received, and credit
cash with all money paid out; therefore, the difference between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
total footings of the debit and credit sides of the cash book shows the
amount of cash which we should have on hand. Since we cannot
pay out more than we receive, the debit side should be the larger, unless
both sides are equal, which shows that we have paid out all the
cash received.</p>

<p>The amounts entered on the debit side of the cash book are
transferred (or <i>posted</i>) to the credit side of the account of the one from
whom the cash is received.</p>

<p>The amounts entered on the credit side of the cash book are
posted to the debit side of the account of the one to whom the cash is
paid.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-051.jpg" width="400" height="321"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>There are many special forms of ruling for cash books, with
separate columns for entering certain classes of receipts and payments
of a special nature. The ruling of the cash book should be made to
meet the requirements of the business in which it is to be used. A
simple form of ruling is shown.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the left-hand page is used for the debit side,
while the right-hand page is used for credits. This is the only account
kept with cash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p><b>16. Journal.</b> A Journal is a book in which separate transactions
are entered in a manner to preserve the balance necessary in
double entry&mdash;that is, showing the proper debit and credit for each
transaction. The journal is used for making adjusting entries, and
it was formerly the custom to copy into this book from the day book
the particulars of every transaction. Records are now made in the
journal directly, which makes it a book of original entry.</p>

<p>The records in the journal are transferred or posted to the debit
and credit sides of the accounts which they represent.</p>

<p>The journal is frequently combined with the cash book, and is
then called a <i>cash journal</i>. An ordinary form of journal ruling is
shown in Article 11.</p>

<p><b>17. Sales Book.</b> A Sales Book is an auxiliary book in which is
kept a record of all goods sold, showing name of purchaser, quantity
and kind of articles, prices, and amounts.</p>

<p>A sales book is a journal of sales. The amounts of individual
sales are posted (transferred) to the debit side of the accounts of the
purchasers. The footings of the sales book are carried forward until
the end of the month, when the total amount is posted as one item to
the credit side of the <i>merchandise</i> account, completing the double entry.</p>

<p>The merchandise account has been universally used in the past,
all purchases being debited and all sales credited to this account.
Certain other accounts (which will be explained later) are now recommended
by leading accountants, to take the place of the merchandise
account.</p>

<p>Sales books are usually ruled to meet the special needs of each
business, separate columns being provided for a record of special
classes of sales, or sales of special kinds of goods.</p>

<p><b>18. Purchase Book.</b> A Purchase or Invoice Book is the opposite
of the sales book, being used for a record of all purchases made.
Like the sales book, the totals are carried forward to the end of the
month, and posted as one item to the debit side of the <i>merchandise</i>
account. The amounts of the separate transactions are posted daily
to the credit of the persons from whom the goods are purchased.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-052.jpg" width="400" height="117"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The purchase book is a purchase journal, and the ruling is the
same as that of other journals.</p>

<p><b>19. Ledger.</b> The Ledger is the principal book, in which particulars
of every transaction of every nature are summarized. It is, in
fact, a transcript of all other books of the business except those used
solely for statistical purposes.</p>

<p>The ledger is the book which contains the final or complete
records of all dealings, either with an individual or with respect to a
specific class of transactions&mdash;as expenditures for a certain purpose, or
receipts of a given character, or sales of a given kind of goods.</p>

<p>A transcript of the ledger accounts exhibits the progress and
standing of the business.</p>

<p>Like other books, ledgers are now made with special forms of
ruling, depending on the purpose for which they are to be used. The
old style or common form of ledger ruling is shown (p. 35).</p>

<p><b>20. Invoice or Bill.</b> An Invoice or Bill is an itemized statement
or record of goods sold by one person to another. The invoice or bill
is used in every line of business. A conventional form of invoice is
shown (p. 5).</p>

<p class="ph">RECORDING TRANSACTIONS</p>

<p><b>21.</b> The records of transactions in the journal which show what
accounts are debited and what accounts are credited are called <i>journal
entries</i>. The act of making these entries is known as <i>journalizing</i>.</p>

<p>It was formerly the custom to journalize each individual transaction
from the day book, but in modern bookkeeping the journal is
used only for adjusting and special entries.</p>

<p><b>22. Posting.</b> When the record of a transaction is transferred
to the ledger from a book of Class (<i>b</i>), it is said to be <i>posted</i>. The act
of making the transfer is called <i>posting</i>.</p>

<p>The original method was to itemize all transactions in the ledger,
but the present custom is to post the totals only.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> When a record is transferred from one book of Class (<i>b</i>) to
another, or posted to the ledger, the page number of the book to or
from which it is transferred or posted is entered in the column known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
as the <i>folio column</i>. This is done that the transaction may be traced
from one book to another. The presence of the page number also
serves as a check to show that the item has been posted.</p>

<p><i>Example</i>&mdash;An item is to be posted from page 1 of the sales book
to page 10 of the ledger. In the folio column of the ledger will be
entered "S 1" indicating that the item will be found on page 1 of the
sales book. In the folio column of the sales book will be entered "10"
indicating that the item has been posted to page 10 of the ledger.</p>

<p><b>24. Ledger Index.</b> An index to the ledger is necessary to enable
us to find the accounts. In small ledgers the index is placed in the
front of the book itself, while for large ledgers a separate index book
is used. There is a distinct advantage in this, as the index book can
be kept open on the desk while posting is being done, and the names
found much quicker than when it is necessary to turn the leaves of
the ledger to find the index.</p>

<p>When an account is opened in the ledger, the name should be
written in the index, followed by the page number. The names in the
index are arranged in alphabetical order, each name being written
under the letter of the alphabet corresponding to the first letter in the
name. For example:</p>

<table id="t03" summary="t0">

 <tr>
  <td colspan="2" class="tdc"><b>A</b></td>
  <td rowspan="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  <td colspan="2" class="tdc"><b>B</b></td>
  <td rowspan="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  <td colspan="2" class="tdc"><b>C</b></td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Adams, J. C.</td>
  <td class="tdr">11</td>
  <td>Bacon, I. H.</td>
  <td class="tdr">2</td>
  <td>Crandall, Jas.</td>
  <td class="tdr">7</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Andrews, Henry</td>
  <td class="tdr">14</td>
  <td>Brown, Henry</td>
  <td class="tdr">9</td>
  <td>Campbell, Don.</td>
  <td class="tdr">12</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">In a large index, one or more pages are used for a letter; while in a
small index, several letters may be placed on the same page.</p>

<p class="ph">SAMPLE TRANSACTIONS</p>

<p><b>25.</b> The following sample transactions are carried through the
books described in this section, showing the proper entries and postings
(see pp. 40-43). The day book has been omitted, as it is practically
obsolete, not being used by progressive bookkeepers.</p>

<p class="ph">PROMISSORY NOTES</p>

<p><b>26.</b> A promissory note is a form of commercial paper much used
in business. Goods are sold on specific terms&mdash;that is, to be paid for
in a certain time after date. Profits are based on the supposition
that the bills will be paid when due. When not so paid, the debtor
is virtually borrowing money from the creditor, and should pay interest
for the use of that money just as he would if he had borrowed it from
a bank. To settle the account when it is not convenient to pay cash,
it is customary to give a promissory note for the amount, plus interest,
payable on a certain date. The promissory note is more convenient
for the creditor; for when it bears his endorsement, his bankers will
discount it, thus giving him the money for use in his business. Even
though he may not discount it, the promissory note is better for the
creditor, as it gives him a definite promise to pay, which he does not
have when the debt is represented by an open account.</p>

<p><b>27. Bills Receivable and Bills Payable.</b> The commercial term
for promissory notes accepted by us is <i>Bills Receivable</i>. The commercial
term for promissory notes given by us is <i>Bills Payable</i>. The
term "bill" is used in this connection for the reason that a promissory
note is a negotiable instrument, and when indorsed it becomes practically
a bill of exchange. The accounts in the ledger which represent
notes receivable and notes payable are called <i>Bills Receivable
Account</i> and <i>Bills Payable Account</i>.</p>

<p>The bills receivable account is debited when a note is received,
and credited when a note is paid. The balance of bills receivable
account shows the amount of unpaid notes payable to us.</p>

<p>The bills payable account is credited when we give a note and
debited when we pay a note. The balance of bills payable account
shows the amount of the notes that we owe.</p>

<p><b>28. Bill Book.</b> For the purpose of keeping a record of bills
receivable and bills payable, a book known as a <i>bill book</i> is used. Any
draft, note, due bill, or other written promise to pay a specified sum at
a stated time, should be treated as a note or bill&mdash;receivable or payable,
as the case may be. The bill book is an auxiliary book, and the
record kept is usually treated as a memorandum only, records of each
transaction being made in the journal. The form shown (p. 45) is
one in common use.</p>

<p><b>29. Acceptances.</b> A draft when accepted&mdash;that is, when it
becomes an <i>acceptance</i>&mdash;has the same value as a promissory note, for
it is a definite promise to pay on a specified date. Drafts are used
for the collection of accounts in other cities than the one in which the
creditor's place of business is located. A draft may call for payment
a certain number of days after date, or it may call for payment at
sight. The former is known as a <i>time draft</i>, while the latter is a <i>sight
draft</i>.</p>

<p><b>30. Discount and Exchange.</b> When a promissory note is taken
to the bank for the purpose of raising money, it is customary for the
banks to calculate the interest for the time the note is to run, and to
deduct this from the principal, giving the borrower the net amount
only. In other words, the interest is paid in advance, and such advance
payment of interest is called <i>discount</i>.</p>

<p>When a draft is collected through a bank, a small fee is charged,
and this fee is called <i>exchange</i>. Exchange is also charged for the collection
of out-of-town checks, especially if they are drawn on banks
in small towns and cities.</p>

<p class="ph">BANK DEPOSITS</p>

<p><b>31.</b> When money is deposited in a bank, a list of the items in
the deposit is made on a blank known as a <i>deposit ticket</i> or <i>deposit
slip</i>. These deposit tickets are furnished by the bank for the convenience
of its customers.</p>

<p><b>32. Signature Card.</b> Money deposited in a bank can be withdrawn
only by presenting a written order or <i>check</i>, signed by the one
in whose name the money is deposited. That the bank may know
that money is not paid on checks that do not bear the correct signature,
each depositor is required to leave at the bank the signature or signatures
which are to be honored. These signatures are written on a
card, known as a <i>signature card</i>, which the bank keeps for reference.</p>

<p><b>33. Check Books.</b> Blank checks are usually bound in book
form, the checks themselves being perforated so that they can be
easily removed. These <i>check books</i> are in most cases furnished by the
bank. The number of checks on a page varies, but is seldom more
than four. When a check is written, the number, date, name, and
amount should be written on the face of the stub. To keep a convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
record of the balance in the bank, it is well to enter a list of
all checks and deposits on the back of the check stubs.</p>

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Signature Card</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>34. Pass Book.</b> The bank <i>pass-book</i> should be taken to the
bank whenever a deposit is made, as it contains the bank's receipt for
all money deposited.</p>

<p><b>35. Indorsement of Checks.</b> Before a check can be deposited
in the bank, it must be indorsed by writing the name of the payee
across the back. The indorsement should be on the back of the left
end of the check&mdash;never on the right end. Several forms of indorsement
are shown (p. 48). When the name only is written, it makes
the check payable to the bearer, and is known as a <i>blank indorsement</i>.
When the words "Pay to" are used, the check becomes payable to the
one whose, name appears immediately under the words. It can only
be paid to him in person or credited to his account at any bank at
which he may deposit the check. A check indorsed with the words
"Pay to the order of" permits of a further transfer, and provides a
receipt from the one to whom it is so indorsed. When a check is to
be deposited, the proper indorsement is "For deposit only." This
is of special importance when deposits are sent by messenger. Such
indorsements usually include the name of the bank, and are made
with a rubber stamp.</p>

<p><b>36. Depositing Cash.</b> It is a good plan to deposit all cash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
received and to pay all bills by check, except such small items as are
paid from petty cash. By doing this, all transactions pass through
the bank, providing a receipt in every case in the form of a canceled
check bearing the indorsement of the payee.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>37. Treatment of Petty Cash.</b>
It is customary in business
establishments to keep on hand a
certain sum of cash out of which
to pay items of expense such as
office supplies, etc., when the
amount is too small or it is not
convenient to write a check.</p>

<p>The best way to handle this
is to draw a check for a certain
amount, and keep this money
separate from the cash received
from day to day. At the end of
the month, or sooner if the fund
is low, draw a check payable to
cash for the amount paid out and
charge it to expense. This will
leave the fund intact.</p>

<p><i>Example</i>&mdash;We shall suppose
the amount of petty cash to be
kept on hand to be $25.00; and
the amount paid out, $15.60,
leaving $9.40 on hand. A check
will be made for $15.60, to be
charged to expense through the
regular cash book. The cash
will be drawn from the bank,
and the amount added to the
$9.40, making a total of $25.00.</p>

<p>A record of petty cash is usually
kept in a small book called a
<i>petty cash book</i>. This book has the regular two-column journal
ruling. In handling petty cash, great care should be taken to secure
a receipt in some form for every payment.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THEORY OF ACCOUNTS</h2>

<h3 class="p2">PART II</h3>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="ph">CLASSES OF ACCOUNTS</p>

<p><b>39.</b> In double entry bookkeeping, the accounts used may be
divided into the two general classes of <i>personal</i> and <i>impersonal</i>.
For the purpose of more complete classification, the second class
is further subdivided into <i>real</i>, <i>representative</i>, and <i>nominal</i> accounts.</p>

<p><b>40. Personal Accounts.</b> A personal account is a record of
transactions with a particular person or persons.</p>

<p><i>Examples</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>A record of transactions with persons who buy goods from us.</p>

<p>A record of transactions with persons from whom we buy goods.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-078a.jpg" width="400" height="154"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p><b>41. Real Account.</b> A real account is a record of transactions
with respect to a particular property. Properties which we possess
are termed <i>resources</i> or <i>assets</i>; therefore all real accounts are also
<i>asset accounts</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-078b.jpg" width="400" height="131"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Examples</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>Real estate (land and buildings), Machinery, Furniture, Merchandise,
etc.</p>

<p><b>42. Representative Account.</b> A representative account is
a summary of all debit or credit transactions of a particular class
with respect to several personal accounts. The debit or credit to
this account completes the double entry, and illustrates the rule that
in double entry there must be a credit for every debit.</p>

<p><i>Example</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>We sell goods to a number of customers, and the amounts of
these sales are debited to their several accounts. To complete the
double entry, we credit the total amount of these sales to an account
called <i>sales account</i>. The total credits to this account during any
given period <i>represent</i> the sales to all customers for the same period,
and the sales account is a <i>representative</i> account.</p>

<p>The total debits to all customers' accounts for goods purchased
in one month amount to $1,423.62. This amount is credited to
the sales account. Likewise the purchases for the same period
amount to $947.20, and the several amounts are credited to the personal
accounts of those from whom the purchases were made, while
a like amount is debited to a representative account known as a
purchase account.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-079.jpg" width="400" height="167"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p><b>43. Nominal Account.</b> A nominal account is a record of
transactions having to do with profit and loss; a record of a particular
class of expenditures from which no direct returns are expected;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
any impersonal account which does not come under the classification
of real or representative accounts.</p>

<p><i>Example</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>We buy coal to be used in heating our building. The coal
is not to be resold, but its use is necessary; it is one of the expenses
of conducting the business, and we charge the amount to an <i>expense</i>
account. Expense is a <i>nominal</i> account kept for the purpose of
showing the total expenses of the business.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-080.jpg" width="400" height="175"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p><b>44.  Merchandise Account.</b> The merchandise account is a
real account formerly much used, but discarded by modern accountants.
When used, this account is debited with all purchases of
merchandise and credited with all sales. The account is also charged
with all goods returned by our customers, and credited with all
goods which we return to those from whom we have purchased
them. Goods returned by our customers are charged at the prices
at which they were purchased by the customers; consequently the
debit side of the merchandise account does not furnish a true exhibit
of our purchases; neither is the credit side a true exhibit of our sales.
Since the merchandise account furnished no valuable information,
other accounts which exhibit more vital statistics have been substituted.</p>

<p><b>45.</b> <i>Purchase account</i> is one of the accounts substituted for
the merchandise account. This account is charged with all purchases
as represented by the footings of the purchase book or purchase
journal. This completes the double entry, the separate
purchases having been credited to the personal accounts of those
from whom the goods were purchased. All returns or other similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
deductions allowed on purchase invoices are charged to those from
whom the purchases were made and credited to purchase account.
The balance of the purchase account then shows the total net purchases.</p>

<p><b>46.</b> <i>Sales account</i> takes the place of the credit side of the
merchandise account. All sales as shown by the footings of the
sales book are credited to the sales account, completing the double
entry. All returns and allowances are likewise charged to the
sales account. The balance of the sales account shows total net
sales.</p>

<p class="ph">SAMPLE TRANSACTIONS</p>

sales book, purchase book, and ledger, demonstrate the uses of the
merchandise, purchase, and sales accounts explained in the preceding

<p>In the second demonstration, the purchase and sales accounts
are used. Total sales are credited to sales account from purchase
book, and returns credited from the journal. The balances of
these accounts show actual net purchases and sales.</p>

<p class="ph">CLASSES OF ASSETS</p>

<p><b>48.</b> Asset accounts are accounts representing resources or
assets of the business. Assets are classified as <i>Fixed</i>; <i>Active</i> or
<i>Floating</i>; <i>Passive</i> or <i>Speculative</i>; <i>Fictitious</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fixed assets</i> are those permanent forms of property which are
a necessary part of the equipment used for conducting the business&mdash;such
as real estate, buildings, machinery, etc.</p>

<p><i>Active</i> or <i>floating assets</i> are those forms of property of which
the quantity in our possession varies from day to day&mdash;as merchandise,
accounts, cash, etc.</p>

<p><i>Passive</i> or <i>speculative assets</i> are those (<i>a</i>) whose values are not
readily determined, or (<i>b</i>) whose values are subject to market fluctuations&mdash;as,
for example, (<i>a</i>) franchises, copyrights, patents; (<i>b</i>)
stocks, bonds, or other speculative securities.</p>

<p><i>Fictitious assets</i> are those which are not represented by tangible
property, or which are of value to a going business but would
have no market value if the business were closed out or liquidated.
These assets are frequently represented by an expense account on
the books. The initial advertising expense necessary to launch
the business successfully is frequently carried on the books as an
asset. The amount of such advertising expense is spread over a
stated period, a certain proportion being charged into the regular
expense accounts each year until the entire amount is used.</p>

<p><b>49. Examples of Fixed Assets.</b> The assets of an ordinary
mercantile business are of the first two classes only&mdash;fixed and
floating. The most common forms of fixed assets of such a business
are:</p>

<p><i>Real Estate</i>&mdash;generally understood to include land and buildings
owned and used in the business.</p>

<p><i>Furniture and Fixtures</i>&mdash;represented by office and store furniture,
shelving, counters, stoves, furnaces or other heating appliances,
lighting fixtures.</p>

<p><i>Horses and Wagons</i> or <i>Trucks</i>&mdash;including all horses, wagons,
trucks, harness, or motor-cars used for hauling goods.</p>

<p>If the business is one in which these classes of property are
dealt in, they become active assets. Land, for example, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
be one of the <i>active</i> assets of a business organized to buy and sell
real estate.</p>

<p><b>50. Examples of Floating Assets.</b> The active or floating
assets of a mercantile business are:</p>

<p><i>Merchandise</i>&mdash;meaning the stock in trade or goods dealt in.</p>

<p><i>Accounts</i>&mdash;the open accounts of customers who owe for goods
purchased.</p>

<p><i>Notes</i> or <i>Bills Receivable</i>&mdash;all outstanding notes payable to the
firm.</p>

<p><i>Cash</i>&mdash;the amount of cash on hand and in the bank.</p>

<p><b>51. Examples of Passive Assets.</b> Passive or speculative assets
are more frequently found on the books of a manufacturing business,
a corporation, or a business a part or whole of which has been
sold by the original owners. Examples of these assets are:</p>

<p><i>Patents</i>&mdash;A manufacturer owns a patent the value of which
depends upon future profits resulting from the manufacture and
sale of the article which it covers. It is customary to place a value
on the patent, and to consider it an asset of the business.</p>

<p><i>Good-Will</i>&mdash;A man has established a business which has become
extremely profitable, and in selling the business he places a
certain value on the reputation or goodwill which he has built up.</p>

<p><i>Speculative</i>&mdash;A firm having a surplus not required in the business
sometimes invests it outside of the business with the expectation
of realizing a profit by selling at an advanced price. They
buy grain or provisions, mining or railway stocks, etc. Or an investment
may be made in the stock of some manufacturing business to
be established in the town, because such an enterprise, if successful,
will naturally result in an increase in their own business.</p>

<p><b>52. Examples of Fictitious Assets.</b> Fictitious assets are seldom
found on the books of other than corporations where a large initial
promotion expense  is involved. A good example of a fictitious
asset is:</p>

<p><i>Advertising</i>&mdash;A business house may decide on an average annual
expenditure for advertising; but to be effective, the expenditures
for the first two or three years may necessarily exceed this amount.
The excess is considered as an investment since it is expected that
as the business becomes firmly established the annual expenditure
can be reduced to an amount even less than that estimated, gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
reducing the amount carried on the books as an asset. To
illustrate:</p>

<p class="ph">REVENUE ACCOUNTS</p>

<p><b>53.</b> The term <i>revenue</i> (synonymous with <i>income</i>) is used to
designate those items which, when brought together in an account,
exhibit the profit or loss of the business.</p>

<p><i>Revenue receipts</i> are the receipts which originate exclusively
from the sale or exchange of the commodities or things of value for
the handling of which the business has been organized.</p>

<p><i>Revenue expenditures</i> are those expenditures connected with
the expense of operation or administration of a business, including
such items of expense as postage, printing, salaries, rent, etc.</p>

<p><i>Revenue accounts</i> is a term used to designate those accounts
that represent revenue receipts or revenue expenditures.</p>

<p><b>54. Revenue Receipts.</b> The account representing revenue
receipts in all lines of business (though it may sometimes be known
by another name) is the <i>sales account</i>&mdash;a representative account
showing net sales. Net sales, less cost of goods sold, represent gross
profits. Gross profits, less cost of conducting the business (revenue
expenditures) represent net profits.</p>

<p><b>55. Expense.</b> The broad term <i>expense account</i> represents
all revenue expenditures; but in modern bookkeeping the amounts
of the different classes of expense are kept separate as far as possible.</p>

<p>Some of the most commonly used divisions of expense are:
Rent; Insurance; Taxes, Interest and Discount; Out Freight and
Express; Heat and Lights; Labor; Salaries, etc. It is customary
to open one account in the name of <i>General Expense</i>, to care for
expenditures not included in special accounts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p><b>56.</b> <i>Insurance</i>&mdash;A nominal account to which is charged all
sums paid to insurance companies (called <i>premiums</i>), in consideration
of which our property is insured against loss by fire, cyclones, or
other disaster.</p>

<p><b>57.</b> <i>Rent</i>&mdash;A nominal account to which is charged all sums
paid for use of property which we rent or lease from others for the
benefit of our business&mdash;usually the buildings in which our business
is transacted or in which our goods are stored.</p>

<p><b>58.</b>  <i>Taxes</i>&mdash;A nominal account to which are charged all taxes
and license fees paid on account of property owned or business
transacted.</p>

<p><b>59.</b> <i>Interest</i>&mdash;This is a nominal account which should include
only interest charges paid or interest earned on account of capital.
When we borrow money or discount a note, we do it because we
need cash capital, and the interest paid is a capital expense or a
direct source of loss. Exchange charged for the collection of notes
and drafts belongs in the same class. All interest paid for the use
of money, and exchange paid for the collection of notes, drafts, and
checks, should be debited to interest account. When we save the
discount by prepayment of bills, the discount is earned by the use
of capital. All such earnings are a direct source of profit and should
be credited to interest account. Discount paid on notes is interest
paid in advance, and should not be confused with discounts allowed
to customers for the prompt payment of bills; the latter is a reduction
in the price received for our goods, and reduces trading profits.
This question is discussed under the head of <i>Cash Discounts</i>.</p>

<p><b>60.</b> <i>Out Freight and Express</i>&mdash;A nominal account which is
debited with all transportation charges paid on goods that we ship,
whether sales are made at delivered prices or freight is paid as an
accommodation to the customer. When goods are sold at f. o. b.
prices, and the freight is paid by us as an accommodation to the
customer, out freight should be credited and the customer debited.</p>

<p>This should not be confused with <i>in freight</i>, or freight paid
on goods received, as such charges add to the cost of the goods and
should be charged to the account representing that particular class
of goods.</p>

<p><b>61.</b> <i>Heat and Light</i>&mdash;This account is debited with all sums
paid for fuel, heating bills, lighting bills, and lighting supplies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p><b>62.</b> <i>Labor</i>&mdash;A nominal account which is debited with all
sums paid as wages to mechanics or laborers employed by the business.</p>

<p><b>63.</b> <i>Salaries</i>&mdash;A nominal account which is debited with all
salaries paid to managers, salesmen, clerks, and others employed
in the administration of the business.</p>

<p class="ph">RULES FOR JOURNALIZING</p>

<p><b>64.</b> Journalizing is one of the most important operations in
bookkeeping, since journalizing a transaction involves the selection
of the proper accounts to be debited and credited completing
the double entry. With the use of separate sales and purchase
records, the journal itself is used principally for those entries involving
a transfer of values from one account to another. These
are frequently referred to as <i>cross entries</i>. The number of possible
entries of this class is practically unlimited, and they require careful
study on the part of the bookkeeper.</p>

<p>Rules for journalizing are frequently referred to in bookkeeping
textbooks; but, since the custom of journalizing every transaction
is now obsolete, the term is no longer sufficiently descriptive.
A better term to use would be <i>rules for debit and credit</i>, for it is the
rules of debit and credit that must be followed when a journal entry
is to be made.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-091.jpg" width="400" height="148"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p><b>65. Three-Column Journal.</b> A three-column journal suitable
for a small business is shown above. The third column is used
for sales only, while the first two columns are used for regular journal
entries. The use of the column for sales answers the same purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
as a sales book, and total sales are posted to the credit of sales
account at the end of the month.</p>

<p class="ph">SAMPLE TRANSACTIONS</p>

<p><b>66.</b> For the purpose of demonstrating the principles of debit
and credit as exemplified in the journal, the following transactions
except those involving cash are <i>journalized</i> in a three-column journal.
The third column is used for sales, and it is to be understood that a
cash account is kept in a separate cash book.</p>

<p class="ph">RULES FOR POSTING</p>

<p><b>67.</b> The act of transferring all items from the journal, sales
book, purchase book, cash book, or other books to the ledger is
called <i>posting</i>. All items relating to one account are posted to that
account in the ledger; thus all sales are posted to the sales account,
and all transactions with a person are posted to the account of that
person. Every debit must be posted to the debit side of the corresponding
account in the ledger.</p>

<p><b>68. Routine.</b> The first operation in posting is to open an
account in the ledger by writing the name of the account on the line
at the head of the ledger page. The month and day are then written
in the date column; the page of the book from which the item is
posted is written in the folio column, and the amount is placed in the
money column. The final operation is to place the number of the
ledger page in the folio column of the book from which the item was
transferred, directly opposite the item posted.</p>

<p><b>Posting from Journal.</b> In posting from the journal, all items
in the left or debit columns are posted to the debit side of the corresponding
ledger accounts, while all items in the credit column are
posted to the credit side of the ledger accounts.</p>

<p>The first item in the journal in the preceding section is a debit
to Hiram Watson, amount $1.15. It is necessary to open an account
in the ledger, which is done by writing Hiram Watson's name at
the head of the page, above the date column on the left side of the
page; in the date column we write the date, April 2; in the folio column
we write the journal page, 1: and in the money column we write the
amount, $1.15. The number of the ledger page is now written in
the folio column in the journal, directly opposite the name of Hiram
Watson.</p>

<p>The second transaction recorded in the journal is a purchase
which makes it necessary to open a purchase account in the ledger,
to which is debited the amount of the purchase $18.75. The first
transaction recorded in the journal is a sale, therefore the credit
is to the sales account. Since we are placing all sales in a special
column, the amount will not be posted until the end of the month,
when the total sales will be posted to the credit of the sales account
as one item. In the second transaction, the credit is to a personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
account, and we open an account in the ledger with Eureka Milling
Co., following the same routine in posting as with debit items, except
that the item is posted to the credit side of the account.</p>

<p><b>Posting from Cash Book.</b> When posting from the cash book,
it must be remembered that all items on the left-hand page (which
debit cash) must be posted to the credit of some other account; and
that all items on the right-hand page (which credit cash) must be
posted to the debit of an account in the ledger.</p>

<p>Why cash received is entered on the left-hand page of the cash
book, and cash paid out on the right-hand page, is a point not always
clear to the bookkeeper. To obtain a clear view of this point, it
should be remembered that the cash book is nothing more or less
than a ledger account with cash, and cash received is entered on the
left-hand page (or debit side) for the reason that any account is
debited for what is received or is added to it.</p>

<p>We sell merchandise, for example, and the person is debited
because he receives it. We buy real estate; the real estate account
is debited because our real estate possessions are added to. Broadly
speaking, we (the business) receive the real estate; but, instead of
charging the amount to ourselves (the person), we charge it to <i>Real
Estate</i>, that we may know the amount of our real estate investment.</p>

<p>A customer pays us cash; cash is debited because our cash
possessions are added to. We might charge the amount to our
account; but we prefer to charge it to a cash account that we may
know how much cash we have on hand. We pay out cash; cash is
credited because cash has gone out of our possession. The main
point of difference is that we post to other ledger accounts direct
from the cash book, which is itself a ledger account, instead of journalizing
cash transactions.</p>

<p>If cash transactions were journalized&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn15">Cash</p>
<p class="pn20">To Person</p>
<p class="pn15">Person</p>
<p class="pn20">To Cash</p>

<p>the amounts would be posted to the debit or credits of the cash
account in the ledger; but for convenience we keep the cash accounts
in a separate book. Journalizing a few of the transactions given
will clearly demonstrate the point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p class="ph">TRIAL BALANCE</p>

<p><b>69.</b> A <i>trial balance</i> is a list of the balances of all accounts
remaining open in the ledger, together with the balance shown by
the cash account. On journal paper, all open accounts are listed
by name; the debit balances are placed in the debit column, and
credit balances are placed in the credit column; the pages of the
ledger are placed in the folio column, opposite the names of the
account. Both debit and credit columns are footed, and the footings
of the two columns should agree.</p>

<p>A trial balance is taken for the purpose of testing the accuracy
of the postings to the ledger; to find out if the ledger is in balance.
The trial balance can be taken without considering the balances, by
taking the total debit and credit items posted to all open accounts.</p>

<p>While the trial balance shows that for every debit posted to the
ledger a corresponding credit has also been posted (double entry
principle), it does not absolutely prove the accuracy of the work.
If a debit item of $100.00 were posted to the debit of the wrong
account, it would not affect the balance of the ledger; but if the
item were posted to the credit instead of to the debit of the account,
the ledger would be out of balance and the amount that it was <i>out</i>would be shown by the trial balance.</p>

<p class="ph">CLASSIFICATION OF ACCOUNTS</p>

<p><b>70.</b> The arrangement of the accounts in the ledger is of considerable
importance. Since one of the objects of bookkeeping
is to exhibit the standing or condition of the business, the accounts
should be classified in a manner that will make easiest the assembling
of important statistics.</p>

<p>The accounts in the ledger represent either <i>Assets</i> (resources),
<i>Liabilities</i>, <i>Profits</i> (gains), or <i>Losses</i>. Every account having a debit
balance represents either (<i>a</i>) an asset or (<i>b</i>) a loss. (<i>a</i>) A personal
account having a debit balance represents an asset; (<i>b</i>) any expense
account having a debit balance represents a loss, as it reduces the
chance for profit.</p>

<p>Every account having a credit balance represents either (<i>c</i>) a
liability or (<i>d</i>) a profit. (<i>c</i>) A personal account having a credit
balance represents a liability&mdash;that is, something we owe; (<i>d</i>) a
sales account having a credit balance represents a profit because it
increases our chance of gain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p><b>71. Arrangement in Ledger.</b> The foregoing classifications
should be kept in mind in arranging the accounts in the ledger.
First provide space for the asset and liability accounts; then follow
with the profit and loss (or revenue) accounts. As far as possible,
keep all asset accounts together, following the same plan with liability
and profit and loss accounts.</p>

<p>The accounts are arranged in the trial balance in exactly the
same order as they appear in the ledger; and if correctly classified
they will show at a glance the assets (except inventories of merchandise)
and liabilities of the business. Likewise the profit and
loss accounts (also known as revenue accounts&mdash;see Article 53) will
show total sales, purchases, and expense of conducting the business.</p>

<p class="ph">SAMPLE LEDGER ACCOUNTS</p>

<p><b>72.</b> The ledger accounts shown on pages 80-81, representing
the transactions given in the preceding set of sample transactions,
demonstrate the proper arrangement of accounts, manner of posting,
and the trial balance.</p>

<p class="ph">EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE</p>

<p>1. From the copy of the journal (Article 66) which you have
made, post the transactions to the ledger.</p>

<p>2. Post the transactions from the journal you have made
(Exercise 2, preceding section) to the ledger.</p>

<p>3. Make a trial balance of the ledger accounts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p class="ph">TREATMENT OF CASH DISCOUNTS</p>

<p><b>73.</b> <i>Cash discounts</i> are discounts allowed for prepayment of
bills. They are frequently confused with bank discounts (or interest
collected in advance when notes are discounted), but are of
an entirely different character.</p>

<p>When the price is made, the profits are calculated with the
idea that the customer may take advantage of the cash discount;
that is, the price after the discount is deducted includes a legitimate
profit. We cannot debit the customer with the amount of the bill
less the discount, for we do not know that he will take advantage
of the discount; and so, the charge to the customer and credit to
sales account is an amount which may never be received.</p>

<p>If the bill is paid less the discount, the amount deducted reduces
our profit on the sale. It is not an allowance for the use of capital,
for we can probably borrow money at 6 per cent, while the discount
may be 5 per cent or more for anticipating payment 30 days
or less.
<b>
74. Discounts Allowed.</b>  Cash discounts allowed must eventually
come out of the profits arising from the sale of the commodities
in which we are trading. There are two methods of charging cash
discounts, either of which is considered correct:</p>

<p>(1) Open an account called <i>Discounts on Sales</i>, and charge
to it all discounts allowed for the prepayment of bills. When the
books are closed, the total will be charged against trading profits.
This method is coming into general use, and may be considered
standard.</p>

<p>(2) Charge to <i>Sales Account</i> directly all discounts allowed,
treating them as allowances. The balance of the sales account will
then represent net sales after returns, rebates, and cash discounts
have been deducted. One feature to recommend this plan is that
sales account does not show a fictitious volume of sales.</p>

<p><b>75. Entering Cash Discounts in Cash Book.</b> When we receive
payment from a customer who has deducted the cash discount,
the discount must be taken account of in entering the payment, as
the customer is to receive credit for the full amount. We might
enter the cash payment in the cash book, and make a journal entry
of the cash discount, but this would necessitate two postings from
separate books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>A better method, and one which has become standard, is to
provide a <i>cash discount column</i> in the cash book. When a column
has not been provided for this purpose, a narrow column can be
ruled in on the cash received or debit side of the cash book. This
is carried as a memorandum until the end of the month, when the
total is posted to the debit of discount on sales. Two ways of making
the entry are shown (p. 84).</p>

<p>In Example No. 1, the cash discount is entered in the discount
column, and the net cash received is entered in the cash column.
When the payment is posted, two entries are made in the ledger.
One advantage in this is that reference to the account of R. L. Brown
&amp; Co. shows at a glance whether they are taking advantage of cash
discounts.</p>

<p>In Example No. 2, the cash discount is entered in the proper
column, but the gross amount is entered in the cash column. The
payment is then posted in one item, and reference to the ledger
account does not show whether the payment of $100.00 is all cash or
part discount. It is necessary, also, to deduct the footing of the
discount column from the footing of the cash column to ascertain
the amount of cash received. For these reasons the method shown
in Example No. 1 is recommended.</p>

<p><b>76. Cash Discounts Earned.</b> When we take advantage of
the discount offered for the prepayment of bills, the discount earned
can be considered a legitimate source of profit. Our own selling
prices for goods purchased to be resold are based on the prices at
which they are billed to us, without considering a possible saving
by discounting our bills. Whether or not we discount our bills is
largely a question of capital, and such earnings are legitimate profits
entirely outside of regular trading profits. Discounts earned
should be treated as interest earned and credited to interest account,
from which they will find their way into profit and loss account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p class="ph">PROFIT AND LOSS</p>

<p><b>77.</b> The <i>profit and loss account</i> is a summary account made up
of the balances of all income and expenditure (revenue) accounts in
the ledger, the balance of this account representing the <i>net loss</i> or
<i>net gain</i> of the business.</p>

<p>It is advisable to show the net profits for each year; and to
accomplish this, it is customary to transfer the balance of profit and
loss account at the end of the year. In single proprietorships and
partnerships, the net gain is transferred to proprietor's or partner's
investment accounts, while in a corporation it is usually transferred
to a surplus account. A loss is transferred to a deficiency account.</p>

<p><b>78. Trading Account.</b> This is a subdivision of profit and loss
account intended to exhibit the gross profit derived from the
manufacture or purchase and sale of goods in which the business is
organized to trade. These profits are known as <i>trading profits</i>. Just
what items of income and expenditure enter into trading profits or
losses is an important question in the science of accounts. A safe rule
to follow is to debit trading account with the cost of goods sold,
including cost of preparing them for sale.  In a manufacturing business
the cost represents cost of raw materials and cost of manufacture.
Credit the account with net income from sales, arrived at
by deducting from gross sales all returns, allowances, rebates, and
cash discounts.</p>

<p>All expenses incurred in selling the goods, and all expense of
administration of the business, should be charged to profit and loss
account proper. All profits arising from other transactions than
trading should be credited to profit and loss. These include interest
received on past due accounts, on notes, or for money loaned; discount
earned by the prepayment of bills; profits from the sale of
real estate or any property other than that in which the business
is trading.</p>

<p><b>Trading Account, How Constructed.</b> The trading account
is made up by charging total inventory at the beginning of the year
and purchases during the year; crediting net sales and inventory at
the close of the year, the balance representing the gross profit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-109a.jpg" width="400" height="139"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p><b>Turnover.</b> It is desirable to know the cost of goods sold. This
is known as the <i>turnover</i>, on which percentages of profit are based.
The turnover may be found by deducting the present inventory
from the debit side of the trading account.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-109b.jpg" width="400" height="186"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p><b>79. Manufacturing Account.</b> In a manufacturing business
it is very desirable to know the cost to produce the goods; and for
this purpose a subdivision of profit and loss, called <i>manufacturing
account</i>, is used. The manufacturing account is debited with inventory
of materials at the beginning of the year; purchases of material;
labor or wages in factory, and all other expenses of manufacture;
and credited with inventory of materials at the close of the year.
The balance represents cost of manufactured goods to the trading
division.</p>

<p>The principal value of these subdivisions of profit and loss
lies in the fact that they reveal not only the <i>amount</i> but the <i>sources</i>
of profits and losses, which is one of the important functions of
accounting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-110a.jpg" width="400" height="141"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The profit and loss account of a professional or other non-trading
concern need not be subdivided as explained for a trading
concern. In a non-trading business, all accounts representing
revenue receipts or revenue expenditures are transferred direct
to profit and loss account.</p>

<p><b>80. Transfer of Gross Profit.</b> The gross profit from trading
is now transferred to the credit of profit and loss account, and this
account is debited with the balances of all revenue expenditure
accounts. Continuing the illustration from Article 78, we have:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-110b.jpg" width="400" height="190"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p><b>81. Transfer of Net Profit.</b> The net gain is transferred to
the credit of proprietor's account in a single proprietorship.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p class="ph">MERCHANDISE INVENTORY ACCOUNT</p>

<p><b>82.</b> The accounts now open in the ledger, other than proprietor's
account, exhibit all assets and liabilities of the business with
the exception of the present inventory, which is included in the
trading account. The amount of the inventory is transferred to the
debit of a merchandise inventory account.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-111.jpg" width="400" height="65"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The books are now said to be <i>closed</i>, there being no open accounts
except those representing assets or liabilities of the business.</p>

<p class="ph">BALANCE SHEET</p>

<p><b>83.</b> A statement of the assets and liabilities of a business is
called a <i>balance sheet</i>. If the assets exceed the liabilities, the
difference is the <i>present worth</i>. If the liabilities exceed the assets,
the business is <i>insolvent</i>, and the difference or balance shows the
amount of insolvency.</p>

<p>The balance sheet is prepared from the ledger balances after
the books have been closed. In arranging the accounts on a balance
sheet, the assets should be listed first, followed by the liabilities.
The balance will agree with the balance shown in the proprietor's
or investment account.</p>

<p>For the business of a single proprietor, it is customary to list
the accounts in the following general order:</p>

<p><i>First</i>&mdash;Cash in bank and office.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>&mdash;Open accounts and bills receivable.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>&mdash;Merchandise per inventory, store fixtures, etc.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>&mdash;Real estate.</p>

<p>The first two classes are termed <i>active</i> or <i>quick</i> assets, as they
can be most readily converted into cash.</p>

<p>The liabilities represented by credit balances, are listed in the
order of their urgency:</p>

<p><i>First</i>&mdash;Open accounts due others.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>&mdash;Bills payable.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>&mdash;Mortgages or bonds payable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The third class represents secured liabilities, while the first two
represent unsecured liabilities.</p>

<p>Continuing the previous illustration, we find the balance sheet
of our imaginary ledger to be as follows:</p>

<p class="ph">JOURNALIZING NOTES</p>

<p><b>85.</b> When a note is received by us or we give our note to another,
it is necessary to make a journal entry in order that there may
be a proper record of the transaction on our books. Careful study
is sometimes necessary to determine just how the entry should be
made, and the following illustrations will serve as a guide.</p>

<p><b>86. When Received.</b> When we receive a note, we debit bills
receivable and credit the maker&mdash;that is, the person who gives us
the note.</p>

<p>We receive a note from Samuel Smart for $100.00 payable in
30 days. The journal entry is:</p>

<table id="t13" summary="t13">

 <tr>
  <td>Bills Receivable</td>
  <td class="tdr">$100.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdp2">Samuel Smart</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">$100.00</td>
 </tr>


 <tr>
  <td>30-day note dated Sept. 10</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1"><b>87. When Paid.</b> When this note is paid, we debit cash and
credit bills receivable. The entry is made in the cash book on the
debit side which debits cash and credits bills receivable.</p>

<table id="t14" summary="t14">

 <tr>
  <td>Bills Receivable</td>
  <td>Samuel Smart's note</td>
  <td>$100.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>due Oct. 10th</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1"><b>88. When Collected by Bank.</b> Perhaps the note was collected
through our bank; in that case, the bank, instead of sending us the
cash, will credit the amount to our account. The bank may, also,
charge a small fee for collecting the money; consequently the amount
placed to our credit will be the sum collected, less their fee. The
entry in the journal would then be:</p>

<table id="t15" summary="t15">

 <tr>
  <td>Bank</td>
  <td class="tdr">$99.85</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Interest and Discount</td>
  <td class="tdr">.15</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdp2">Bills Receivable</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">$100.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Smart's note due Oct. 10th</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Collected by bank.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1"><b>89. When Discounted.</b> At the time we received Samuel
Smart's note, we may have needed the money for immediate use
in our business. We would then take the note to the bank, endorse
it payable to the bank, when they would discount it, giving us credit
for the net proceeds. Since the money is advanced to us, the bank
would charge us interest for its use, which amount would be deducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
from the whole amount, leaving the net proceeds. This
amount would then be available for immediate use. The note is
then the property of the bank; it has gone out of our possession
and we have received the cash. The note is not paid, and in discounting
it we have created a liability to the bank. Remembering
that one of the functions of bookkeeping is to exhibit the true
nature of our assets and liabilities, we open a <i>Bills Discounted</i> account
in the ledger. The entry is:</p>

<table id="t16" summary="t16">

 <tr>
  <td>Bank</td>
  <td class="tdr">$99.50</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Interest</td>
  <td class="tdr">.50</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdp2">Bills Discounted</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">$100.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Discounted Smart's note due Oct. 10th.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1"><b>90. When a Note Drawing Interest is Discounted.</b> The
above transaction presupposes that the note is given <i>without</i> interest;
but if it were given <i>with</i> interest, the bank would simply add the
interest to the principal and deduct the discount from the total.
In the case the sum of the principal and interest ($100.00 + .50 =
$100.50) is $100.50, and the discount $.50, which would leave
$100.00 as the net proceeds. If the amount of the note were larger
or the interest was figured for a longer time, it would make a difference.
Suppose the amount of the note to be $2,000.00, time 30
days, interest 6% per annum.</p>

<table id="t17" summary="t17">

 <tr>
  <td>Principal</td>
  <td class="tdr">$2,000.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Interest 30 days</td>
  <td class="tdr">10.00</td>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdp2">Total</td>
  <td class="tdr">$2,010.00</td>

 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">$1,999.95</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">Since the net amount realized is less than the face of the note, we
need not consider the interest earned, but the entry would be:</p>

<table id="t18" summary="t18">

 <tr>
  <td>Bank</td>
  <td class="tdr">$1,999.95</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Interest and Discount</td>

</table>

<p class="p1"><b>91. When a Note Drawing Interest is Paid.</b> But suppose
Samuel Smart's note is $100.00 for 30 days, with 6% interest, and
that the note is kept by us and the money is paid directly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
us when due. We shall then receive the interest, in addition to the
face of the note, making a total of $100.50. The entry would then
be made in the cash book on the debit side, and would be:</p>

<table id="t19" summary="t19">

 <tr>
  <td>Bills Receivable</td>
  <td class="tdr">$100.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Interest and Discount</td>
  <td class="tdr">.50</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td colspan="2" >Samuel Smart's note due Oct. 10, paid to-day.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1"><b>92. When a Discounted Note is Not Paid.</b> When we discounted
Samuel Smart's note of $100.00 for 30 days without interest at the
bank, we were obliged to endorse it, which had the effect of a guarantee
of payment. If not paid when due, the amount would be
charged to our account at the bank. The note would again come
into our possession, and the amount must be debited to some
account, the credit being to the bank.</p>

<p>We have previously credited the amount to bills discounted,
and our entry is:</p>

<table id="t20" summary="t20">

 <tr>
  <td>Bills Discounted</td>
  <td class="tdr">$100.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdp2">Bank</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">$100.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td colspan="2">Samuel Smart's note not paid at maturity.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">But suppose the transaction to have been the one described
in Article 90. The note returned to us is $2,010.00, that being
the amount of principal and interest. Our bills receivable and
bills discounted accounts show the item as $2,000.00 only. Therefore
we must include the $10.00 in our adjusting entries which will be:</p>

<table id="t21" summary="t21">

 <tr>
  <td>Bills Receivable</td>
  <td class="tdr">$10.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td colspan="3">Interest added to Smart's note not paid when due</td>

  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">$2,010.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td colspan="2">Smart's note not paid at maturity.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1"><b>93. When a Note is Past Due.</b> The above entries leave this
unpaid item in the bills receivable account. If the business is one
in which a large number of bills are discounted, it will be advantageous
to show past due bills receivable by themselves, leaving
bills receivable account to represent only paper not due. The entry
for a bill unpaid at maturity would be:</p>

<table id="t22" summary="t22">

 <tr>
  <td>Bills Receivable Past Due</td>
  <td class="tdr">$2,010.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdp2">Bills Receivable</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">$2,010.00</td>

 <tr>
  <td colspan="3">Smart's note past due.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1"><b>94. When a Note is Renewed.</b> We shall now suppose that
Samuel Smart finds that he will be unable to pay his note when
due. He comes to us and offers a new note for 30 days, which we
accept. He prefers to add the interest due on the original note
to the principal, and makes his note for $100.50. We then return
the original note and the entry is:</p>

<table id="t23" summary="t23">

 <tr>
  <td>Bills Receivable</td>
  <td class="tdr">$100.50</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdp2">Interest and Discount</td>

  <td class="tdp2">Bills Receivable</td>
  <td class="tdr">$100.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td colspan="3" class="tdli">New note given by Samuel Smart to cover note due Oct. 10, with interest.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">The effect of this transaction is that we have received a new note for
$100.50, and we debit bills receivable. This new note pays an older
one which goes out of our possession, so we credit bills receivable.
The amount of the new note includes the interest on the old, and
we credit interest.</p>

<p>We might have gone about this in a roundabout way by making
these entries:</p>

<table id="t24" summary="t24">

 <tr>
  <td colspan="2"><i>To cancel the old note:</i></td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Samuel Smart</td>
  <td class="tdr">$100.50</td>

 <tr>
  <td colspan="3" class="tdli">Note due Oct. 10th.</td>

  <td class="tdr">$100.50</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td colspan="3">New note 30 days to take up note due Oct. 10th.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">These entries would leave the accounts in exactly the same condition
as our first entry, and would serve no useful purpose. This
is given as an illustration of how several entries may be made when
the transaction could be as clearly explained in one.</p>

<p><b>95. When Renewed Note Has Been Discounted.</b> If the note
which Samuel Smart has renewed has been discounted at the bank,
we must reimburse the bank in some manner before we can obtain
possession of the original note. The most simple way to handle
this transaction will be to give the bank our check to pay the note.
The entry is:</p>

<table id="t25" summary="t25">

 <tr>
  <td>Bills Discounted</td>
  <td class="tdr">$100.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Interest and Discount</td>
  <td class="tdr">.50</td>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdp2">To Bank</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">$100.50</td>

 </tr>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">We shall then treat the new note as previously explained. If, after
getting it recorded on the books, we wish to discount this note, the
entries will be exactly the same as when we discounted the original
note.</p>

<p><b>96. When We Give or Pay a Note.</b> When we give our note,
the effect of the transaction is just the opposite of the receipt of a
note. Instead of adding to one class of our resources we are increasing
one class of our liabilities, in return for which we either receive
something of value or reduce our liabilities of another class. When
we give our note in payment of a loan, we receive cash; if we buy
goods and give a note in payment, we receive merchandise; if we give
a note in payment of an account, we simply reduce our liabilities of
one class and add to those of another.</p>

<p>The entries necessary to properly record transactions involving
notes given or bills payable, are not so complex as is the case
with transactions involving bills receivable. The following illustrations
cover transactions likely to arise in the average business:</p>

<p>We give our note for $100.00 payable in 30 days, without interest,
to Western Grocer Co. in settlement of an account. The
entry is:</p>

 <tr>
  <td colspan="3">Note 30 days without interest</td>

<p class="p1">When we pay the note the entry is:</p>

</table>

<p class="p1"><b>97. When Our Note Has Been Discounted.</b> The Western
Grocer Co. has either discounted the note or placed it in the bank
for collection, and it is presented for payment by the Merchants
Bank. We give them a check in payment, and the entry is:</p>

<p class="ph">JOURNALIZING DRAFTS</p>

<p><b>103.</b> When a draft has been accepted, it should be treated
the same as any other form of bill receivable or bill payable. If
we make a draft on a customer, which he accepts, it becomes a bill
receivable. If we accept a draft drawn on us, it becomes a bill
payable.</p>

<p>Sight drafts are frequently made use of as a convenient means
of collecting an account. Such drafts are taken to our bank for
collection, but they do not give us credit for the amount until the
draft is paid. Drafts of this kind, which are placed with the bank
for collection only, are not treated as bills receivable, as we do not
credit the account of the one on whom it is drawn until payment
is received.</p>

<p><b>104. When Our Sight Draft is Paid.</b> We draw on Samuel
Smart at sight for $50.00 through our bank. When paid, we receive

<h2 class="p4">SINGLE PROPRIETOR'S AND PARTNER'S ACCOUNTS</h2>

<p class="ph">RETAIL BUSINESS</p>

<p><b>1.</b> In this section we demonstrate complete sets of books for
a retail business, showing every necessary step in bookkeeping
from the opening of the business. The first set represents a small
business in which the simplest methods are adequate. The business
is owned by a single proprietor who opens a retail grocery store.</p>

<p><b>2. Opening the Books.</b> Remembering that bookkeeping is
the art of recording the transactions of a business, the first thing
to be done is to make the proper opening entry of the books. Being
the opening entry, it should record the first fact of importance,
which is that the business has been opened. Since bookkeeping
should exhibit the exact financial standing of the business, the next
step will be a complete statement of assets and liabilities.</p>

<p>It is customary to make this opening entry on the first page
of the journal. The entry should be a plain statement of facts
which can be readily understood by anyone.</p>

<p><b>3. Books Used.</b> In this set, the books used are Journal,
Cash Book, and Ledger. In addition a <i>counter book</i> or <i>blotter</i>, corresponding
to a day book, is used. This is a rough book in which
are recorded sales on account, cash purchases, and sometimes payments
on account. The entries are merely memoranda of transactions,
made when they occur, to be later entered in the regular
books. No bookkeeper being employed, it would be inconvenient
for the proprietor or his clerk to go to the desk and make a detailed
entry every time a sale is made, and so the transaction is entered in
pencil in the blotter. Bookkeeping records must be permanent,
and should always be made in ink; and it is advisable, when possible,
to have all entries made in one handwriting.</p>

<p>A sample page of the blotter, which illustrates its use, is shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
(p. 3). The marks // indicate that the item has been transferred
to journal or cash book.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> The ledger used is one with journal ruling. In posting,
each item is entered in the ledger. This is a very satisfactory
plan for a small business, as the items of which each charge is
composed can be seen at a glance. More space is required for an
account, but the saving in time in making statements is a distinct
advantage, especially when the proprietor is his own bookkeeper.
With the ordinary style of ledger, it is necessary to refer to books of
original entry to find the items.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-133.jpg" width="400" height="130"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Ledger with Journal Ruling</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>5. Statements.</b> Customers frequently request detailed statements
of account which will give full particulars of each transaction,
including each item. At other times the proprietor sends statements
to his customers, with a request for payment. When this is
done, it is not necessary to enter each item, a statement of the balance
due being sufficient unless an itemized statement is requested by
the customer.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> The business is opened by William Webster on the 21st
day of November, 190-. He is to conduct a retail grocery business,
and has rented a store from Wm. Bristol at a monthly rental of $30.00.
His resources consist of cash $600.00; merchandise, consisting of a
miscellaneous stock of groceries, $964.50; personal accounts due him
as follows: Henry Norton, $25.00; L. B. Jenkins, $22.70. His liabilities
consist of two accounts due for goods purchased, as follows:
Brewster &amp; Co., Rochester, N. Y., $115.20; Warsaw Milling Co.,
$64.00. The opening entry, which furnishes a permanent record
of these facts, is shown (p. 4).</p>

<p><b>7. Proprietor's Account.</b> The proprietor's account is an
account representing capital when the business is owned by a single
proprietor. When the business is started, this account is opened in
the name of the proprietor (Wm. Webster, Proprietor), and to it is
credited his net investment. From time to time the books are closed
and the proprietor's account then receives credit for the net profits
or is debited with the net losses of the business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>When the proprietor withdraws money or goods from the business
for his personal use, the amount may be charged to his investment
or proprietorship account, or to a personal account (Wm.
Webster, Personal) opened in his name. The latter method is recommended
by some writers for the reason that the proprietor's personal
expenses, or those of his family, are then separated from the
expenses or capital expenditures of the business. As a customer of
the business, he is placed on the same basis as any other individual.
But the personal account must be closed some time; he must pay
it in cash, or close it into profit and loss so that it finally operates to
reduce his net investment.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that the question whether withdrawals
are charged to the investment or a personal account is largely a
matter of personal preference.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> The opening entries having been made, the books are now
ready for the recording of the regular transactions of the business.
The following transactions are shown in the model set, but the blotter
is omitted, all transactions being entered in the journal and cash
book. The sample page of the blotter described in Article 3 is
sufficient to illustrate its use.</p>

<p>At the close of business, Nov. 30, a trial balance of the ledger
accounts is taken. No attention is paid to the accounts which are
closed, the open accounts being only included in the trial balance.</p>

<p>The proprietor wishes to know whether the business has made
or lost money, and what the gross and net profits (or the losses) have
been. To obtain this information the books are to be closed. Before
this process can be completed, it is necessary to know the value
of goods now in stock&mdash;that is, to <i>take an inventory</i>.</p>

<p class="ph">INVENTORY</p>

<p><b>10.</b> An inventory is taken by counting, measuring, or weighing
all goods in stock. The stock is listed on journal paper or in
a day book, listing first the quantity; second, the name of the article;
third, the price; fourth, the value of each item.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Trial Balance</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>11. Pricing.</b> In taking an inventory, <i>all goods must be priced
at cost&mdash;never at the selling price</i>. If selling prices are used, credit
is being taken for profits which cannot be earned until the goods are
sold. It may even be found advisable at times to list goods at less
than cost. Some classes of goods deteriorate; at other times the
stock may contain merchandise that was purchased on a high market,
on which prices have been materially lowered. To price such goods
at actual cost prices is creating fictitious values. Conservatism
is necessary in pricing an inventory, for the taking of credit for
unearned profits is wrong in principle.</p>

<p>This inventory shows the cost of goods in stock to be $1,042.77.</p>

<p><b>12. Closing the Books.</b> This is the process of balancing all
revenue accounts, and transferring the balances to the profit and
loss account, the balance of the account being finally transferred
or closed into the capital, surplus, or deficiency account, as the case
may be. We have learned that in a single proprietorship, profit
and loss is finally closed into capital or investment account.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>This being a trading business, the first step is to open a <i>trading
account</i> for the purpose of finding the gross profit. The accounts
now in the ledger to be closed into trading account are <i>merchandise</i>,
<i>inventory</i>, and <i>purchases</i>, which are entered on the debit side; and
<i>sales account</i>, which is entered on the credit side. The present inventory
is now entered on the credit side; the two sides of the account
are footed; and the difference or balance represents the gross gain
or loss.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> The trading account shows a credit balance or gross
profit of $92.00. This balance is now closed into profit and loss,
being entered on the credit side. The only revenue account now open
is expense, which shows a debit balance of $38.00. This is a revenue
expenditure, representing a loss, and is therefore transferred to the
debit or loss side of profit and loss account.</p>

<p>Profit and loss shows a credit balance or net profit of $54.00.
The balance closes into the account of the proprietor, where it is
entered on the credit side increasing his net investment to $1,487.00.</p>

<p>NOTE&mdash;Complete postings from page 4 of the journal.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> <i>A balance sheet</i> should now be prepared; and if our work
is correct in every particular, the present worth will correspond in
amount with the net investment shown by the proprietor's account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p class="ph">RETAIL COAL BOOKS</p>

<p><b>16.</b> The proprietor wishes to retire from the grocery business,
and, having an opportunity to sell the stock at inventory value, does
so, receiving $1,042.77 in cash.  He immediately pays sundry
accounts payable, $149.02.  He collects all accounts receivable
except the amount due from L. B. Jenkins, $24.45. This leaves
him with assets consisting of cash $1,462.55; due from L. B. Jenkins,
$24.45; and no liabilities.</p>

<p>He next engages in the retail coal business, investing his entire
assets. He rents an office and yards at $40.00 per month, and
engages a teamster who owns a team and wagon, paying him $24.00
per week.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> In this business there are introduced a sales book, with
which the student is familiar, and a form of ledger known as <i>center
ruled</i> (p. 25). This form at first appears slightly confusing; but
there is considerable advantage in having the debit and credit columns
side by side, as balances can be calculated more readily.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> The cash book used is one having three columns. On
the debit side the third column is used for cash sales. The footing
is carried forward until the end of the month, or any other time when
a trial balance is desired, when the amount is posted in one item.
All bills are paid by check, the money received being deposited in
the bank.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> An auxiliary book used in this business is a <i>scale book</i>, in
which are recorded the weight of wagon, gross and net weights.
Weighing the delivery wagons used by the business each morning
is sufficient; this weight can be used on each load hauled for the
day.  And on deliveries made by the regular wagons, it is not
necessary to record the weight of each load in the scale book; knowing
the tare, the net weight can be recorded in the sales book.</p>

<p>The principal use of the scale book is to record the weights
of coal sold at the yards and hauled by the purchaser. When a
wagon comes to the yard for a load of coal, it is of course necessary
to obtain first the weight of the empty wagon; and it is important
that both this and the gross weight be permanently recorded to
prevent later disputes. The scale or weight book is usually made
with sheets of from four to six weight tickets, perforated, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
stubs which are exact duplicates of the tickets. The perforated ticket
is given to the customer and the stub remains in the book as a permanent
record.</p>

<p>Since it is necessary to enter the weights in two places, and
because this duplication of work is liable to result in errors, a better
plan would be to omit the stub and make the book with carbon
duplicate tickets. Even with the old style of book a sheet of carbon
paper can be placed between two sheets and two copies of the ticket
made at one writing; the record sheet to remain in the book. See
illustration, p. 26.</p>

<p><b>20. Uncollectable Accounts.</b> In the closing entries of the last
model set, we have shown that the gross trading profits are represented
by the balance of trading account. All profits from other
sources are credited directly to profit and loss account; likewise all
other losses are charged directly to profit and loss. One such source
of loss is <i>uncollectable accounts</i>. To charge the loss resulting from
an uncollectable account against trading profits would create a false
showing in respect to the trading profits during the current period,
for the reason that the account may represent sales made during a
former period.</p>

<p class="ph">SALES TICKETS</p>

<p><b>23.</b> In a retail business it is necessary for the sales person to
record purchases at the time the goods are selected by the customer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
When but one or two clerks are employed, it is possible to record
these sales in a counter book or blotter; but in a larger business employing
several clerks, this method would be extremely inconvenient.
The bookkeeper would be obliged to wait for the books; and even
if two sets of counter books were provided for use on alternate days,
the work would always be at least one day behind.</p>

<p>The increase in the volume of business transacted, and the multiplicity
of transactions in a retail store, have been responsible for
the introduction of many labor-saving methods and devices. One
of these now used in all large stores and in many small ones, is the
<i>sales ticket</i>.</p>

<p>The sales ticket is to all intents and purposes a small invoice
blank. Sales tickets are put up in pads or in book form, and are
numbered in duplicate. The number is prefixed by a letter&mdash;as
<i>H 10</i>&mdash;which is intended to indicate either the department or the
sales person. When a sale is made, the ticket or bill is made in
duplicate by means of carbon paper; one copy is given to the customer,
and the other retained. If it is a cash sale, the copy retained
goes to the cashier with the money; if a sale on account, to the bookkeeper
to be charged.</p>

<p>These sales tickets are also used for taking orders for future
delivery, both copies being retained until the order is filled. When
delivery is made, one copy goes to the customer as a bill. Aside
from the time saved, the sales ticket is a great convenience, as its
use gives the customer a bill for every purchase.</p>

<p class="ph">DEPARTMENTAL RECORDS</p>

<p><b>24.</b> When the goods sold are divided into departments, it is
here customary to record carefully the purchases and sales for each
department. These records are provided for by the use of purchase
and sales books having as many columns as there are departments.
Let us suppose that the business under consideration is a single
proprietorship, and that the goods sold are clothing, shoes, and furnishings.
Each class of goods is kept in a separate department,
sales and purchases being recorded by departments.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> Purchase and sales books of a special design are used,
each having three special columns. It will be noted that neither
purchases nor sales are recorded in detail, but that both purchase
invoices and sales tickets are recorded by number, and only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
totals extended in the proper column. The charges and credits
are posted to personal accounts from the purchase and sales books.
All purchase invoices are filed in numerical order. The sales tickets
are kept in bundles, each day's tickets by themselves. The tickets
of each department and each sales person are also kept by themselves.
If it becomes necessary at any time to know the items of an invoice
or sales ticket, it is an easy matter to refer to the files under the
proper date and number for the desired information.</p>

<p>The combined totals of the three department columns must
equal the footing of the total column. All footings are carried forward
until the end of the month, when the totals are posted directly
to purchase and sales accounts, completing the double entry. In
the ledger, purchase and sales accounts are kept with each department;
but when the books are closed, the results from all departments
are combined in the trading account. Instead of recording
cash sales in a special column in the cash book, all receipts of this
kind are entered in the regular <i>cash received</i> column. These sales
are not posted from the cash book, but are entered in the sales book
daily. Thus they are carried forward in the footings, and at the
end of the month the totals of the sales book represent all sales,
both on account and for cash.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> The cash book in this set presents some new features.
Instead of using both pages of the book, one page is used for both
debit and credit. The bank account is also kept in the cash book,
debit and credit columns being provided for this purpose. Deposits
are entered in the bank debit column and in the cash credit column.
Checks are entered in the bank credit column and posted to individual
accounts.</p>

<p>The other books used are the journal and ledger. The journal
is used only for adjusting entries which cannot be made through
the other books.</p>

<p class="ph">SAMPLE TRANSACTIONS</p>

<p><b>27.</b> The business is opened by C. D. Walker, who invests
$3,500.00 cash, which he deposits in the bank. The following
transactions are recorded:</p>

<p class="ph">PARTNERSHIP</p>

<p><b>29.</b> Legal authorities define a partnership as a combination
by two or more persons, of capital, labor, or skill, for the transaction
of business for their common profit.</p>

<p>Partnerships may be formed for the purpose of conducting
any legitimate business or undertaking, and are created by contract,
expressed or implied, between the parties. Partnership agreements
need not be in writing, but may be made by oral assent of
the parties. Even though they are legal if made orally, partnership
agreements should always be made in writing.</p>

<p><b>30. Partnership Agreements.</b> These should state the date on
which the agreement is entered into, the name of the contracting
parties, the name by which the partnership is to be known, and
the address of the place of business. Following should be a statement
of the nature of the business, the amount and form of investment
of each partner, the duration of the partnership, the basis of
division of profits, provisions for the dissolution of the partnership,
definition of the duties of active partners, and a provision for the
division of the assets in the event of dissolution or at the termination
of the partnership.</p>

<p><b>31. Kinds of Partners.</b> Partners are of different kinds, depending
on the nature of the partnership agreement and the extent
of their liability, expressed or implied, as between themselves or in
respect to third persons. The usual classification of partners is
as follows: <i>ostensible</i>, <i>secret</i>, <i>nominal</i>, <i>silent</i>, and <i>dormant</i>.</p>

<p>Ostensible partners are those whose names are disclosed to
the public as actual partners.</p>

<p>Secret partners are those whose names are not disclosed to
the public, though participating in the profits.</p>

<p>Nominal partners are those who allow their names to be used
as partners, though they may have no actual interest in the business.
The fact of their being known as partners makes them liable
to third parties.</p>

<p>Silent partners are those who, while sharing in the profits, take
no active part in the management of the business. Their names
may or may not be known. Silent partners may also be secret
partners,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Dormant partners are those, who are both silent and secret
partners. They are usually included in a general term like <i>Company</i>,
<i>Sons</i>, or <i>Brothers</i>.</p>

<p><b>32. Participation in Profits.</b> The most simple partnership
from an accounting standpoint is one in which the investments of
the several partners are equal, and profits are to be divided equally.</p>

<p>This condition does not exist in all partnerships. The members
of the partnership may invest unequal amounts and share in
the profits on the basis of their investment. The investment may
be equal, but one partner may receive an extra share of the profits
in return for work performed in lieu of a salary. The investment
may be unequal, but the one with the smaller investment may share
equally in the profits in return for work performed. It is not unusual
for a silent partner to furnish all of the capital and share equally
in the profits with an ostensible partner who assumes full responsibility
for the management of the business.</p>

<p><b>33. Interest on Investment.</b> When the investment of the
partners is unequal, it is customary to allow interest on the capital
invested and to charge interest on all withdrawals. The interest
on capital must be credited, and the interest on withdrawals must
be charged, before profits can be distributed.</p>

<p><b>34. Capital and Personal Accounts.</b> In a partnership a special
account should be opened in the name of each partner to represent
his investment (for example, John Smith, Capital). To this
account is credited his net investment. When the books are closed,
the account is credited with his share of the profits, and debited
with his withdrawals.</p>

<p>A personal account should be opened in the name of each partner,
to which is debited all withdrawals, either of money or goods.
Even when the capital invested is equal, some partnership agreements
provide that interest shall be charged on all withdrawals, particularly
when the business is of such a nature that goods traded in are
likely to be withdrawn by the partners, or when, for any reason,
withdrawals are likely to be unequal. The balance of the partner's
personal account is closed into his capital account when the books
are closed. Before closing this account, it should be credited with
interest on capital account and charged with the interest provided
on withdrawals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p><b>35. Opening the Books.</b> When the books of a partnership
are opened, the essential features of the partnership agreement
should be written at the top of the first page of the journal. Next
following the partnership agreement, are the entries showing the
nature and amount of the investment of each partner, the amounts
being posted to the credit of partners' capital accounts.</p>

<p><b>36. Closing the Books.</b> When the books of a partnership
are to be closed, the revenue accounts are closed into trading and
profit and loss, the same as in any other form of business organization.
The net profit is then apportioned according to agreement,
the share of each partner being credited to his capital account.
The balance of his personal account is then carried to his capital
account; the balance of that account will then show his net investment.</p>

<p><b>Illustration of Closing Entries.</b> A, B, and C form a partnership,
each investing $1,000.00, profits to be shared equally. When the
books are closed, the net profits are found to be $909.60. A's personal
account shows a debit balance of $46.50; B's personal account
shows a credit balance of $100.00; C's personal account shows a
credit balance of $52.00. The entries are as follows:</p>

<p class="ph">SAMPLE TRANSACTION</p>

<p><b>37.</b> The first business taken up for consideration under the
head of partnerships is a retail shoe business. The stock is kept
in three classes: men's, women's, and children's shoes. Purchase
and sales books, ruled to segregate transactions of each class, are
used. The bank account is kept in the cash book, which is also
provided with two columns for discount. All sales, whether for cash
or on account, are recorded on sales tickets.</p>

<p>James Benton, Horace Douglas, and Henry Kemp form a
partnership under the firm name of Benton, Douglas &amp; Kemp, for
the purpose of conducting a retail shoe business in Buffalo, N. Y.
The date of the agreement, which is to continue for ten years, is
March 1, 1908. James Benton invests $1,000.00 in cash and a
stock of shoes inventorying $2,000.00 as follows: men's, $800.00;
women's, $700.00; children's, $500.00. Horace Douglas and Henry
Kemp each invest $3,000.00 in cash. The three partners are to
share equally in the profits and each is to receive a salary of $100.00
per month. The books are to be closed and net profits divided at
the end of each three months' period counting from January 1, which
brings the first distribution on March 31.</p>

<p>The following transactions are recorded during the month of
March:</p>

<p><b>38.</b> 1. Submit a trading and a profit and loss account as
shown by the books at the close of business March 13.</p>

<p>2. What errors do you find in these books?</p>

<p>3. Submit a balance sheet.</p>

<p>4. Submit the journal entries to be used in apportioning the
profits, and in closing partner's personal account. Show partners'
capital accounts after final closing.</p>

<p>5. Submit proper entries when Kemp's interest is purchased,
assuming that he is paid by check from the funds in hand.</p>

<p>6. Submit trial balance of ledger of Benton &amp; Douglas as
the accounts appear after the purchase of Kemp's interest. Remember
that no additional capital is invested.</p>

<p><b>39. Sale of Partnership.</b> When the business of a partnership
is sold, the net assets must be divided among the partners according
to agreement, unless the partnership is to continue for the transaction
of the same or some other class of business. As a rule, the
liabilities are paid (if possible), from the cash funds on hand, leaving
the net assets for division.</p>

<p>In the division of assets, one partner will frequently agree to
accept a certain class of assets in lieu of cash, but at a discount.
To illustrate, one partner might accept fixtures, which cost $1,000.00,
at 10% discount. Deducting 10% from the cost price of the fixtures
reduces the assets just that amount, and it is necessary to debit
profit and loss and to credit fixture account, with the loss.</p>

<p>If any class of assets, other than the goods in which the firm is
trading, bring a price above cost, it is necessary to debit the purchaser
and credit profit and loss with the profit. If the stock regularly
traded in is sold at a profit, no special entry is required; the sale
is recorded in the regular way and credited to sales account, from
which it finds its way into profit and loss in the final closing of the
books.</p>

<p>This class of transactions involves but one of the many kinds
of adjusting entries, all of which necessitate careful study on the
part of the bookkeeper. In making adjusting entries, full explanations
should be given that their meaning or intent may not be misunderstood
by one who later refers to them. It is better to err on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the side of what may appear as too detailed explanation, than to
leave anything to be taken for granted.</p>

partners is unequal, the partnership agreement usually provides

on withdrawals.</p>

A invests $7,000.00, and B invests $3,000.00. The agreement
provides that interest at 6% shall be credited on capital and charged
on withdrawals at the time of closing the books, profits to be shared
on the basis of their investments.</p>

<p>For the final closing of the books, we would close the personal
accounts of A and B into their capital accounts, and close profit
and loss account into their capital accounts. In actual practice
the interest on withdrawals and investment would be entered and
charged to profit and loss through interest account, before the net
profit is brought down. In our illustration we have first brought
down what appears to be the net profit, for the purpose of emphasizing

<h2 class="p4">CORPORATION ACCOUNTS</h2>

<p class="ph">CORPORATIONS</p>

<p><b>1.</b> A corporation is an artificial body created by statute law and
vested with power to act in many respects as an individual&mdash;in particular
to acquire, hold, and dispose of property, real or personal; to make
contracts; to sue and be sued, and the like.</p>

<p>It is a legal entity apart from its members. It may sue without
joining its members, and may be sued by others without the necessity
of joining its members. It may transfer property and transact all
business, not inconsistent with the rights granted by its charter, in
its own name. In the transaction of business it is regarded as an
individual.</p>

<p class="ph">CLASSIFICATION OF CORPORATIONS</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Corporations may be divided into two general classes&mdash;public
and private. A <i>public</i> corporation is a political entity organized
for the purposes of government&mdash;as a city, county, or village.
A <i>private</i> corporation is one organized to further the interests of its
members. These may be divided into two classes&mdash;stock corporations
and non-stock corporations.</p>

<p>A <i>stock</i> corporation is one organized for the pecuniary gain of
its members.</p>

<p>A <i>non-stock</i> corporation is one organized to further a particular
object&mdash;as clubs, charitable associations, societies for scientific research,
etc.</p>

<p>Stock or business corporations are the ones with which we are
chiefly concerned. Such corporations are organized to enable several
persons to unite their capital to conduct a legitimate business enterprise
and such organization accomplishes two important results; the
rights of the members to transfer their interest without affecting the
standing of the business, and exemption from personal liability for
contracts or acts of the corporation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>In a partnership, each individual partner is liable for the debts of
the partnership, and any partner can make contracts in the name of
the partnership, such contracts becoming obligations of net only
the partnership but of each individual partner.</p>

<p>A member or stock holder in a corporation is, as a rule, liable
only for the amount of his subscription to the capital stock of the
corporation. The exception to this is the organization of certain
classes of corporations in which it is provided that a stockholder
shall be liable for twice the amount of his stock subscription. National
Banks are examples of this class. No stockholder, as such, has the
right to make contracts in the name of the corporation, and any contracts
he may make are not binding on the corporation. Contracts
made in the name of the corporation, to be binding, must be executed
by an officer duly authorized to make such contracts.</p>

<p><b>3. Joint Stock Companies.</b> <i>How distinguished from corporations.</i>
A joint stock company is a large partnership in which the
capital is divided into shares which are distributed among the partners
in proportion to their interests. Joint stock companies differ from
corporations and are like partnerships in the following respects:</p>

<p>Each member is liable for the debts of the company, and if he
sells his shares he is still liable for the debts which were contracted
while he was a shareholder.</p>

<p>Except when otherwise provided by statute, all members must
join in any action at law by the company, and if another brings an
action against the company he must join as many shareholders as he
wishes to hold. In some states the law provides that an action
against a joint stock company may be brought in the name of its
president or other designated officer representing all the members.</p>

<p><b>4. Joint Stock Companies.</b> <i>How like Corporations.</i> A joint
stock company is like a corporation and differs from a partnership
in the following respects:</p>

<p>The shares may be transferred. If a member dies his shares
pass to his estate; if bankrupt they pass to his assignee; if he sells his
shares they pass to the purchaser. Partners may withdraw and new
partners may be admitted without the dissolution of the company.
A partnership is dissolved by the withdrawal by death or otherwise of
a single partner.</p>

<p>The shareholders do not manage the affairs of the company but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
elect directors or other officers in whom the management of the business
is vested. Members, as such, have no authority to bind the
company.</p>

<p class="ph">CREATION OF CORPORATIONS</p>

<p><b>5.</b> A corporation is created by legislative act. Formerly each
corporation received a special charter from the legislature of the state,
but as the advantages of corporations began to receive universal
recognition it was seen that the delays incident to the granting of
special charters were bound to work a hardship on those desiring to
incorporate. Partly to overcome this, but more particularly to insure
uniformity in the rights and privileges of corporations, and to prevent
the conferring of special privileges through special charters, the
legislature of most states has enacted uniform corporation laws.
These statutes prescribe uniform regulations for the organization of
corporations. State constitutions now very generally prohibit the
granting of special charters to private corporations.</p>

<p><b>6. Requirements.</b> While every state has its own corporation
laws, the requirements of corporations are in many respects uniform.
The law usually provides that a certificate of incorporation shall be
filed with the secretary of state, or some other designated officer.
This certificate must as a rule state:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">The name of the corporation;</p>

<p class="pbq">The place of business, where its principal office is located;</p>

<p class="pbq">The objects of the corporation, including a statement of the business in
which it is to engage;</p>

<p class="pbq">The amount of the capital stock, and the number and par value of the
shares into which it is to be divided;</p>

<p class="pbq">The period for which the corporation is organized;</p>

<p class="pbq">The number of its directors and the names of those who are to serve at
the outset;</p>

<p class="pbq">The names and addresses of the original incorporators with the number of
shares of the capital stock subscribed for by each.</p>

<p class="pbq">The form of the certificate required in the state of Illinois is
shown in the illustration, p. 4.</p>

<p class="ph">STOCKHOLDERS</p>

<p><b>7.</b> The members of a business corporation are known as stockholders
or shareholders. At the time of organization the members
subscribe for the shares of the capital stock agreeing to take and pay
for them when issued. When the stock has been delivered and
paid for, the stockholder is under no further obligation, unless the
stock is by statute or contract subject to assessment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-215.jpg" width="400" height="647"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p><b>8. Stock Certificate.</b> When a stockholder has paid for his
shares a certificate, known as a stock certificate, is issued to him.
This certificate is the written evidence issued by the corporation that
the person whose name appears therein is registered on the company's
books as the owner of shares of the number and par value named.</p>

<p>The owner of a stock certificate can transfer it, and the one to
whom it is transferred becomes a stockholder. Such transfers are
not complete, however, until registered on the books of the company.
A stock certificate is not, strictly speaking, a negotiable instrument,
but it is the custom among business men to indorse stock certificates
in blank and transfer them from hand to hand as negotiable instruments,
until some one inserts his own name and has the transfer
registered on the books of the company.</p>

<p>Such indorsement does not make a stock certificate a negotiable
instrument, and the purchaser can acquire no better title than is
possessed by the seller. Courts have held that the fact that a certificate
of stock is not payable to bearer makes it non-negotiable.</p>

<p class="ph">CAPITALIZATION</p>

<p><b>9.</b> This is the term commonly used to designate the amount of
stock which the company is authorized to issue. It may have little
reference to the amount subscribed or paid in, for most states authorize
corporations to begin business as soon as a certain number of shares
have been subscribed for, or even when only a small part of the subscriptions
have been paid. For instance, a company with an authorized
capitalization of $100,000 may be permitted to commence business
as soon as $10,000 has been subscribed and $1,000 is actually paid in.</p>

<p><b>10. Capital and Capital Stock.</b> The <i>capital</i> of a corporation is
usually understood to mean its assets, and is a general term covering
all of its property of every nature. It has no connection with the
capital stock authorized or the number of shares subscribed.</p>

<p><i>Capital Stock</i> is a term used in many ways each of which implies
a different meaning. It may mean the amount which must be paid
in before it can transact business as a corporation; it may mean
the capital which the corporation is authorized to issue; it may mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the amount subscribed regardless of the amount actually paid in;
or it may mean the amount actually paid in regardless of the amount
subscribed.</p>

<p><b>11. Kinds of Stock.</b> As a rule the capital stock of a corporation
is of two classes&mdash;common and preferred&mdash;though not all corporations
issue both classes.</p>

<p><i>Common Stock</i> is the stock of a corporation issued to all stockholders
under the same conditions, and which is to share equally in
the dividends.</p>

<p><i>Preferred Stock</i> is stock which gives its owner certain preferences
over the owners of common stock. This preference usually consists
of a provision for the payment of certain dividends out of the net
earnings of the business before any dividends can be paid on common
stock. The officers of a corporation have no power to issue
preferred stock unless it is provided for in the charter. Preferred
stock may, however, be issued with the consent of all common stockholders.
Preferred stock falls into subdivisions depending upon its
provisions as follows:</p>

<p><i>Cumulative</i> preferred stock is stock on which the payment of
dividends is not dependent upon the earnings of one year. If a
dividend is passed in one year or if not paid in full, it must be paid
from future earnings before common stock can draw dividends.</p>

<p><i>Non-cumulative</i> preferred stock is stock which carries a dividend
preference only in respect to the earnings of the current year. While
dividends are payable prior to dividends on common stock, no liability
attaches to the corporation if earnings in any year are insufficient
to pay dividends.</p>

<p><i>Guaranteed Stock</i> is another name for cumulative or non-cumulative
preferred stock&mdash;any stock on which the payment of dividends
is guaranteed.</p>

<p>A corporation may issue more than one series of preferred stock,
as <i>first preferred</i>, <i>second preferred</i>, etc. These issues take preference
in the payment of dividends in the order of their priority. Dividends
must be paid on <i>first preferred</i> before any surplus is available for the
payment of dividends on <i>second preferred</i>.</p>

<p><b>12. Treasury Stock.</b> This is stock subscribed for and issued which
has been acquired by the corporation either by purchase or donation.
The term is often erroneously applied to that part of the authorized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
capital stock which has never been issued, and the error has even
been made of referring to it as unsubscribed stock. Treasury stock
is an asset and should be so treated on the books of the corporation.
Unsubscribed or unissued stock is in no sense an asset; or as one
writer puts it, no more an asset than the power of a person to issue
notes is an asset.</p>

<p><b>13. Watered Stock.</b> Any stock which is not represented by
actual assets is called watered stock. It is usually represented by
fictitious assets&mdash;as patents, copyrights, franchises, promotion expense,
goodwill, etc.</p>

<p class="ph">STOCK SUBSCRIPTIONS</p>

<p><b>14.</b> It is customary for the first board of directors to state
by resolution in what manner the stock is to be disposed of; if subscriptions
are to be received; if subscriptions are to be paid immediately
or in installments. When the certificate of incorporation has
been filed the subscription list is opened. This may be in book form,
or a written or printed list. The following is a common form of stock
subscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">We, the undersigned, do hereby subscribe to the capital stock of the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;company, organized under the laws of the state of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;in
the amount set forth below, and severally agree to pay the amount of such
subscription as follows:</p>

<p class="pbq">When the board of directors shall, through its secretary or treasurer,
certify that there has been subscribed&mdash;&mdash;% of the authorized capital of
$&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, then we severally agree to pay&mdash;&mdash;% of said subscriptions, and
to pay a further&mdash;&mdash;% on the&mdash;&mdash;day of each month thereafter, until the
full amount of such subscriptions shall have been paid.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
</div>

<p class="ph">MANAGEMENT OF CORPORATIONS</p>

<p><b>15.</b> The affairs of a corporation are managed by its directors who
are elected by the stockholders. A director has no authority individually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to bind the company. He can only act in conjunction with other
directors in regular meeting as provided by the by-laws. The acts
of the board are effected by orders or resolutions passed at such meetings.
The number of directors constituting the board and the number
required to form a quorum is specified in the by-laws. Directors
must attend meetings in person to be entitled to vote. They cannot
be represented by proxy. Since it is not practicable for the directors
to attend to all of the details, they usually delegate to their officers
authority to transact all of the every day business of the company.
In larger corporations the directors organize themselves into subcommittees
as executive committee, finance committee, etc. In
small corporations these committees are unnecessary, their acts being
performed by the board of directors.</p>

<p><b>16. Powers of Directors and Officers.</b> The powers of the
directors are extensive and are prescribed by the charter and by-laws.
The directors have the power to bind the corporation in all its dealings
with other persons or corporations. The powers of the stockholders
are limited to the election of the directors; but as the directors
are elected by a majority of the stockholders, the power to control the
corporation through the election of a board of directors who will
respect their wishes is thus conveyed to a majority of the stockholders.</p>

<p>Being representatives of the stockholders as a body, the directors
must at all times be governed by what they honestly consider the wishes
of the majority. Directors have the power to make contracts with
the corporation only when they are manifestly fair contracts. For
example, when not otherwise provided for, they may fix a fair compensation
for their services and for the services of their officers.
Except in cases of actual fraud, it is for the majority of stockholders
to complain of such contracts, and they have the power to remove
offending directors.</p>

<p>Officers of a corporation are its agents and have limited powers,
usually prescribed by the by-laws. When not so specified, they are
prescribed by the directors. It is not always necessary that all of the
powers of an officer be specified in detail. If an officer has been
accustomed to perform certain acts with the knowledge and consent
of the directors, his acts become binding on the corporation. The
title of an office does not necessarily convey any special powers. For
example, while it is customary for the directors to confer special powers
on the president, his title does not make him, in the corporation's
dealings with the public, an agent of higher grade than the secretary,
treasurer, or any other officer.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p><b>17. Powers of Corporations.</b> As such, a corporation possesses
certain necessary powers, and such other special powers as may be
conferred by its charter.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">To have a corporate name which can only be changed by law.</p>

<p class="pbq">To sue and be sued.</p>

<p class="pbq">To possess a corporate seal.</p>

<p class="pbq">To appoint the necessary officers for the conduct of its business.</p>

<p class="pbq">To enact by-laws necessary for the management of its business, for
transferring of its stock, for calling of meetings, etc.</p>

<p class="pbq">To acquire and dispose of such property as may be necessary for the
conduct of the business for which it is organized.</p>

<p class="pbq">To make contracts necessary for the carrying out of its purposes.</p>

<p class="pbq">In general a corporation can engage in no other business than that
specified in its charter, but it is granted certain incidental powers necessary to
carry out its original purpose.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>18. Stockholder's Rights.</b> Each stockholder has the right to
have a certificate of stock issued to him; to vote at meetings of stockholders;
to inspect the books of the company; to participate
in dividends; to invoke the aid of the courts in restraining the directors
from committing a breach of trust.</p>

<p class="ph">DIVIDENDS</p>

<p><b>19.</b> Every business corporation is conducted with a view to
earning profits. When such profits are distributed to its stockholders
they are called dividends, but stockholders cannot participate
in the profits until a dividend has been declared by the directors.
The law specifies that dividends must be paid out of the net surplus
of the company, and provides a penalty for their payment out of
capital. Therefore, before declaring a dividend, the directors must
be provided with a balance sheet and use every care to determine
that a surplus actually exists. For dividend purposes, surplus is
usually considered that part of the profits remaining after paying
expenses and providing the necessary reserve to cover depreciation
of machinery and buildings and losses from uncollectable accounts.
Sometimes a further provision is made in the by-laws for the creation
of a sinking fund for the payment of bonds.</p>

<p>The times for the payment of dividends are fixed in the certificate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of incorporation or the by-laws. Provision is usually made for
the payment of dividends either quarterly, semi-annually, or annually.</p>

<p>Directors have full discretion in the declaration of dividends and,
so long as they are acting in good faith, may add profits to capital
instead of declaring a dividend. When the directors have, by proper
resolution, stated that the surplus, or a part of the surplus, shall be
distributed to the stockholders, a dividend is said to have been declared.
When declared, a dividend becomes a debt of the corporation
to its stockholders. It is not necessary that the directors declare
dividends of all the surplus or net profits. Frequently the by-laws
provide that a certain amount be reserved as working capital, and
under any circumstances the questions of the advisability of declaring
a dividend rests with the directors. They cannot be compelled to
declare a dividend unless it can be shown that, in declining to do so,
they are acting in bad faith.</p>

<p><b>20. Stock Dividends.</b> At their discretion, the directors may,
instead of paying a dividend in cash, declare what is known as a
stock dividend. When there remains certain unsubscribed stock, or
when the corporation is in possession of treasury stock, this stock may
be issued to stockholders in payment of dividends. A stock dividend
cannot, however, be declared when it would not be proper to declare a
cash dividend. The assets must exceed all liabilities, and in determining
the existence of a surplus available for dividends, all capital
stock that has been issued must be considered as a liability.</p>

<p class="ph">CLOSING TRANSFER BOOKS</p>

<p><b>21.</b> In large companies it is customary for the board of directors
to close the stock transfer books a certain number of days prior to the
date of payment of a dividend, for the purpose of obtaining the names
and addresses of all stockholders. Notices are then sent to all stockholders
that a dividend will be paid on a certain date and that the
transfer books will be closed for a stated period. Transfer books
are also frequently closed for a certain period prior to the annual
meeting of the stockholders. The laws of some states provide that
only those stockholders whose names have appeared as stockholders
on the books of the company for at least thirty days prior to the date
of the annual meeting, shall be entitled to vote at said meeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p class="ph">STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS</p>

<p><b>22.</b> Meetings of stockholders are, as a rule, held annually, and
the date of such meeting is usually specified in the charter. At the
annual meeting the board of directors presents, through its president
or other officer, a report of the business for the year, accompanied by a
financial statement. At this meeting the stockholders elect directors
to take the place of those whose terms of office have expired. A
stockholder may vote at stockholders' meetings either in person or by
proxy, and is entitled to one vote for each share of stock registered in
his name at the time of the meeting. Notice of a stockholders' meeting
must in all cases be mailed to each stockholder at his last known
address, a certain number of days prior to the date of the meeting.
This notice is mailed by the secretary of the company.</p>

<p class="ph">SALE OF STOCK BELOW PAR</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Many corporations formed to carry on business of a speculative
nature find it difficult to sell stock at par. This is especially true
when the assets consist largely of patents, an undeveloped mine, or
property of a similar nature. It has become the custom for corporations
to take over such properties, issuing in payment for the same
full paid stock greatly in excess of its value. The original owners
of the property will in turn donate a certain portion of the stock to
the corporation to be sold to provide working capital. This stock
then becomes treasury stock and is offered for sale at a liberal discount.
The selling of property to a corporation at an inflated value
is called the process of watering the stock. It can only be justified
when an uncertainty exists as to the actual value of the property
acquired. In the purchase of a going business, the real value of the
goodwill is largely a matter of opinion, and the judgment of the
board of directors of a corporation making such a purchase must be
considered as final.</p>

<p class="ph">CORPORATION BOOKKEEPING</p>

<p><b>24.</b> Bookkeeping for a corporation as a record of its business
transactions with the public is not different than bookkeeping for a
single proprietorship or a partnership. There are, however, certain
necessary records peculiar to a corporation, including accounts of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
financial nature between the corporation and its stockholders. It
is with these records and accounts that we are concerned in this discussion
of corporation bookkeeping.</p>

<p><b>25. Books Required.</b> The books required for corporation
records are, <i>Stock Certificate Book</i>, <i>Stock Transfer Book</i>, <i>Stock Ledger</i>,
<i>Minute Book</i>, (and in certain cases, <i>Installment Book</i>, <i>Stock Register</i>,
and <i>Dividend Book</i>). These are auxiliary books and are known as
<i>stock</i> books.</p>

<p><i>Stock Certificate Book.</i> This is a book of stock certificates, with
stubs giving full particulars of each certificate issued. When a stock
register is used, the record is posted to it from the stub, otherwise
posting is made direct from the stub to the stock ledger.</p>

<p><i>Stock Transfer Book.</i> This is a book in which is kept a record
of all transfers of stock. Each entry is practically a copy of the form
of assignment found on the back of the stock certificate. It is supposed
that each transfer will be signed by the one transferring the
stock, but frequently when certificates are presented with the proper
endorsement, the transfer is signed by the one making the transfer
as <i>attorney in fact</i>. The transfer book is made with two, and sometimes
three, transfers to a page. Transfers are posted to the stock
register, when used, or direct to the stock ledger.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Stock Ledger.</i> This is the book in which an account is kept with
each stockholder showing the number of shares held by him. Sometimes
the amount is included. When a stockholder receives a certificate
of stock it is posted to the credit side of his account in the stock
ledger. When he transfers a certificate it is posted to the debit side
of his account. A trial balance of the stock ledger should be taken
at stated periods, for the stock standing to the credit of the stockholders
should equal the total stock outstanding. The stock ledger
is supposed to show only the stock issued and the names of its holders.
For example, if the authorized stock of a corporation is 1,000 shares
and there remains 300 shares unsubscribed, the stock ledger will
show 700 shares&mdash;the total issued&mdash;to the credit of individual stockholders.
An account should be opened in the stock ledger with
<i>Capital Stock</i>, which account will be debited with all stock issued.
This is in effect a representative account since it represents the total
stock that should stand to the credit of other accounts in the stock
ledger.</p>

<p><i>Minute Book.</i> This is a record book in which the secretary
keeps records or minutes of the proceedings of all stockholders' and
directors' meetings. This is an official record of the acts of the
corporation, and is frequently called for to be introduced in court as
evidence. The secretary is custodian of the minute book and should
see that it is carefully preserved.</p>

<p><i>Installment Book.</i> When stock subscriptions are payable in
installments, a form of receipt called a scrip or installment certificate
is issued. As payments are made they are endorsed on the back of
this certificate, and when all payments have been made the scrip is
exchanged for a regular stock certificate. These scrip certificates
are bound in book form similar to stock certificates.</p>

<p>Sometimes the scrip certificate takes the form of an installment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
receipt for the amount paid, all receipts being surrendered to the
company when payments have been completed.</p>

<p><i>Stock Register.</i> Some large corporations keep, in addition to
the stock ledger and transfer books, a stock register which is a complete
register of all stock issued. This book is kept by the <i>registrar</i>&mdash;usually
a trust company or bank. All certificates are entered in the
register in numerical order and full particulars of each are given.
When a transfer is made both the old and new certificates must be
taken to the registrar, who cancels the old and places his indorsement
on the new, certifying that it has been registered.</p>

<p>One purpose of having a registrar is to prevent an over-issue of
stock. The number of shares shown on the register must not exceed
the number of shares which the corporation is authorized to issue.</p>

<p><i>Dividend Book.</i> When the directors declare a dividend it is
necessary to make a list of stockholders entitled to receive a dividend.
Large corporations use a special form similar to the one illustrated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
It is made either in a book or on loose sheets which are placed in a

<p class="ph">OPENING ENTRIES</p>

<p><b>26.</b> In opening the books of a corporation it is necessary to first
get the capital entered. In a proprietorship, the capital is credited
to the owner; in a partnership it is credited to the individual partners.
On the books of a corporation an account called capital stock is
opened, to which capital is credited. This account is opened in the
general ledger and original entries are made in the journal. The
manner of making the opening entries depends upon the method of
disposing of the capital stock.</p>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdp2">Subscriptions to treasury stock</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">$15,000</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">The discount is, to all intents, a bonus given to the purchasers,
and if, as frequently happens, purchasers are promised a bonus of a
share of stock for every share purchased, it would be proper to make
the following entry in the first place.</p>

<table id="t68" summary="t68">

</table>

<p class="p1">In any dividend distribution the purchasers are entitled to draw
dividends on the face value of their stock, since it was issued to them
as full paid. It would be manifestly unfair to charge the discount or
bonus against profits for the current year, and it is customary to
spread it over a period of several years, charging off a certain per cent
each year. The bonus account is, in the meantime, carried on the
books as an asset, and belongs in the class known as <i>fictitious</i> assets.</p>

<p>Treasury stock is an asset, its real value being the market value
of the stock represented. In the event of liquidation of the company,
treasury stock would off-set the liability on account of capital stock.
When all of the treasury stock is sold the account closes itself; or if
it is issued to stockholders in the form of stock dividends, it is closed
into profit and loss.</p>

<p>Working capital is a liability, which may be termed an <i>assumed</i>
or <i>nominal</i> liability. Like capital stock it is a liability only as between
the company and its stockholders. It off-sets whatever form of
asset&mdash;cash or otherwise&mdash;that represents proceeds from the sale of
treasury stock. The real position of working capital in the balance
sheet is that of a capital liability which must be considered before
any surplus available for dividends can be said to exist. Power is
usually given the directors to reserve a certain amount for working
capital, and even though an actual surplus may exist they have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
right to off-set this with a working capital liability instead of declaring
a dividend.</p>

<p><b>29. Premium on Stock.</b> The stocks of many well-managed
enterprises sell at a premium. In all such cases the amount received
above the par or face value is credited to an account called <i>premium
on stock</i>. At the end of the year this account is closed into surplus
account. If any such items are standing on the books it can be
used to off-set bonus account or organization expenses. It is not
proper to close premium account into the current profit and loss
account, for while it represents a profit, it is not earned in the regular
operations of the business.</p>

<p><b>30. Reduction of Working Capital.</b> As before stated, so long
as working capital remains on the books it must be treated as a liability.
Having the right to create working capital, the directors also
have the right to reduce it whenever, in their judgment, the necessities
of the business no longer require its maintenance in the original
amount.</p>

<p>A reduction of working capital has the effect of increasing surplus,
since surplus is increased by an increase of assets or a decrease of
liabilities. To reduce working capital, the account is closed into
surplus. It is perhaps necessary to say that the account should not
be closed into profit and loss, since it does not represent current
profits.</p>

<p>Suppose that in the case of the National Manufacturing Co., it
is desired to reduce working capital from $50,000 to $25,000; the
entry would be:</p>

<table id="t69" summary="t69">

<p class="ph">EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. A corporation is organized with a capital of $50,000.00,
divided into 500 shares of $100.00 each. The corporation begins
business when 250 shares have been subscribed for. Of this amount
<i>A</i> subscribes for 100 shares, <i>B</i> for 100 shares, and <i>C</i> for 50 shares.
These shares are paid for in cash within 30 days after the date of
subscriptions.</p>

<p>Six months later the balance of the stock is subscribed for, subscriptions
being received from <i>A</i> for 50 shares, <i>B</i>, 50 shares, <i>D</i>, 100
shares, and <i>E</i>, 50 shares. <i>C</i> sells 50 shares to <i>B</i>. These new
shares are paid for in cash.</p>

<p>Make all entries in general books.</p>

<p>Make all entries in stock books.</p>

<p>2. <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i> organize a corporation with an authorized
capitalization of $100,000.00, divided into 1,000 shares of $100.00
each. <i>A</i> subscribes for 400 shares, <i>B</i>, 300 shares, and <i>C</i>, 200 shares.
The corporation buys from <i>D</i> land and buildings for $20,000.00,
paying him $10,000.00 in cash and issuing to him 100 shares of stock.</p>

<p>Subscriptions are paid as follows: <i>A</i> pays $20,000.00 cash and
gives his note due in 60 days for $20,000.00; <i>B</i> pays $20,000.00 cash
and gives his note for $10,000.00 payable in 30 days; <i>C</i> pays $10,000.00
cash and gives his note for $10,000.00 payable in 10 days.</p>

<p>Make all entries in journal and cash book and post to ledger.</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Land and buildings are grouped under the head of real estate.</p>

<p class="p1">3. John Davis and Daniel Greene own the La Belle mine, and
to secure capital for its development they decide to organize a mining
company and to sell shares. A corporation is organized with a capitalization
of $1,000,000.00 in shares of $1.00 each. Of this stock
999,000 shares are issued to Davis and Greene, each receiving an
equal number, and they, in turn, deed the La Belle mine to the company.
The remaining 1,000 shares are subscribed and paid for by
Martin Otis. Davis and Greene donate to the treasury 49,800 shares
to be sold for the purpose of securing working capital. The directors,
by proper resolution, decide to sell 200,000 shares: 50,000 shares
to be sold at 20 cents on the dollar, 50,000 shares at 25 cents,
and 100,000 shares at 35 cents. The resolution also provides that
the corporation's liability for working capital shall be no more than
the amount realized from the sale of treasury stock. Subscriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
are received for the 200,000 shares and payments are made at the
prices specified.</p>

<p>Make all necessary entries to get these transactions properly
recorded on both the general and stock books.</p>

<p class="ph">STOCK ISSUED FOR PROMOTION</p>

<p><b>32.</b> Frequently when a corporation is organized, stock is issued
to a promoter as payment for his services. An enterprise may have
great latent possibilities provided sufficient capital can be secured
for its development, but until the possibilities for making a profit
can be clearly shown, it is difficult to interest the investing public.
To interest investors in an enterprise yet to be developed requires a
special talent not possessed by the average owner of a patent, mine,
or process. There are men who possess this special talent and who
make a business of promoting companies.</p>

<p>In many cases&mdash;probably most cases&mdash;the owner of the thing to
be promoted has no money with which to pay the promoter. Consequently,
the promoter first satisfies himself that the enterprise actually
holds possibilities of profit and then agrees to accept all or a part of
his fees in the stock of the company. The portion of his fee that he
is willing to accept in stock, and the number of shares demanded, is
governed largely by his own faith in the enterprise. His fee may be
a certain per cent on the stock sold, or it may be an arbitrary sum
represented by a certain number of shares. When he accepts his
entire fee in stock, it may represent from 25 per cent to 50 per cent
of the entire capitalization, and while the fee may appear exorbitant
when represented by the par value of the stock, its actual value to
him is represented by the <i>real</i> value of the stock, or the price at
which he could sell it.</p>

<p>Volumes might be written on the subject of promotion, but our
special concern is the proper treatment of promotion fees on the books
of the company. Strictly speaking, promotion fees are as much an
expense as the cost of printing the company's prospectus, but to
immediately charge it to expense would, in many cases, cause the
accounts to show an impairment of capital at the outset. Suppose,
for example, that a corporation is organized with a capital of $100,000.00
all paid in cash. The promoter is paid a fee of $15,000.00.
Profits earned&mdash;trading profits&mdash;in the first year are $8,000.00, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
we have a charge of $15,000.00 for promotion in the expense account.
The books show that the company is insolvent, the liabilities being
$7,000.00 in excess of the assets, while the business actually is in a
healthy condition.</p>

<p>Expenses paid in the regular course of business are expected to
be off-set by earnings. When we pay rent for a store or office we
expect that, by reason of our occupancy of that store or office as a
place of business, our earnings will be increased in an amount greater
than that paid for rent. Promotion expense cannot, in itself, produce
earnings. The cash, or other form of asset, received from the
sale of stock&mdash;the direct result of promotion expense&mdash;is off-set by
the stock liability created. Earnings to off-set promotion expense
must come from future operations of the business.</p>

<p>It has become quite the general custom, therefore, to allow the
expense incident to the organization of the company to stand on the
books as a fictitious asset, under some such caption as <i>promotion expense</i>,
<i>promotion fund</i>, or <i>organization expense</i>. The amount is
gradually reduced by charging a stated per cent to profit and loss
each year.</p>

<p>There is another special reason why it would be manifestly
unfair to immediately charge promotion fees to expense. Suppose a
promoter receives 20% of the stock for his services, while the holders
of the remaining 80% have paid cash for their shares. Since the
80 per cent paid in cash must earn dividends on the entire 100 per cent
of stock, it would be unjust to the holders of the 80 per cent to withhold
dividends until the par value of the 20 per cent of stock shall
have been added to the assets of the company from profits earned.</p>

<p><b>The Entry.</b> A patent is owned by Geo. Davis, who secures the
services of Wm. Lane to promote a company to undertake its manufacture.
The corporation is capitalized at $500,000.00. Davis sells
the patent to the company receiving $250,000.00 stock in payment,
and Lane receives $25,000.00 stock for promotion, when he has
secured subscriptions for the remaining $225,000.00 at par. The
entries to record the issue of stock to Lane for promotion are:</p>

<p class="ph">SURPLUS AND DIVIDENDS</p>

<p><b>33.</b> The directors are under no obligation to distribute in dividends
the profits earned in any one year. Instead, the by-laws usually
provide that the decision as to when a dividend shall be declared is
to be left entirely to the directors. They have it in their power to
retain of the profits such an amount as, in their judgment, is advisable
or necessary to safeguard the interests of the company. At the close
of the fiscal year it is customary to close profit and loss account, and
in a corporation it is closed into surplus.</p>

<p><b>34. Surplus Sub-divided.</b> Sometimes the term surplus is
used to designate a part of the profits set aside for a special purpose,
as the creation of a fund to meet an obligation falling due at some
future date. When surplus is treated as a special fund, or when it
has been provided by resolution of the directors "<i>that a certain sum,
or a certain per cent of the profits shall be set aside as a surplus fund</i>,"
and remaining profits not distributed as dividends may be placed to the
credit of an account called <i>Undivided Profits</i> or <i>Undistributed Profits</i>.</p>

<p>In reality undivided profits is surplus, and the division of the
account merely serves to show that the amount credited to surplus
is for some reason reserved, while the amount credited to undivided
profits is available for dividends whenever the directors may so elect.
Whether or not the surplus should be shown in the balance sheet under
these various headings, or all under the general head of surplus, with
explanatory notes, is a question which need not concern us at this
point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p><b>35.  Declaring a Cash Dividend.</b> When a dividend is declared
an account should be opened under the caption <i>Dividends Payable</i>
or <i>Dividend No. 1.</i>, etc. We will suppose that a dividend has been
declared out of the profits of the business for the current year. The
entry is:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq10 p1">Profit and Loss</p>
<p class="pbq10i">Dividends payable</p>
<p class="pbq10">Dividend of&mdash;&mdash;% declared<br />
by the board of directors<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;1909, payable&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;1909.</p>

<p class="p1">When the dividend is paid the entry will be&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq10 p1">Dividends payable</p>
<p class="pbq10i">Cash</p>
<p class="pbq10">To pay dividend payable<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;1909.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>36. Declaring a Stock Dividend.</b> Not all dividends are paid
or payable in cash. Sometimes the directors declare a dividend
payable in stock and this is known as a stock dividend. There may
be treasury stock in possession of the treasurer, and if the books show
a surplus, which would make it proper to declare a cash dividend,
a dividend may be declared payable in treasury stock. When such
a dividend is declared the entry is&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq10 p1">Profit and Loss</p>
<p class="pbq10i">Stock dividend</p>
<p class="pbq10">A dividend of&mdash;&mdash;% declared<br />
by the board of directors<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;1909 payable&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;1909,<br />
payment to be made in<br />
treasury stock<br />
Stock dividend</p>
<p class="pbq10i">Treasury stock</p>
<p class="pbq10">To pay stock dividend<br />
declared&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;1909.</p>

<p class="p1">The shares are then transferred on the stock books debiting
treasury stock and crediting stockholders.</p>

<p>It is not absolutely necessary that a company possess treasury
stock to declare a stock dividend. When current profits are large
or a surplus, larger than the requirements of the business demand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
has been accumulated, a stock dividend may be declared by issuing
additional shares, provided the original stock has not all been subscribed
for.</p>

<p>If a large surplus has been accumulated and a part of the stock
is unsubscribed, a stock dividend would require the following entries:</p>

<p class="pbq10 p1">Surplus</p>
<p class="pbq10i">Stock dividend</p>
<p class="pbq10">A stock dividend of&mdash;&mdash;%<br />
declared by the directors&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;1909<br />
payable in the unissued<br />
stock of this company.</p>
<p class="pbq10i">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="pbq10">Subscriptions</p>
<p class="pbq10i">Capital stock</p>
<p class="pbq10">Additional stock subscriptions<br />
received from the following.</p>
<p class="pbq10i">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="pbq10">Stock dividends</p>
<p class="pbq10i">Subscriptions</p>
<p class="pbq10">Stock dividend due stockholders<br />
used to off-set subscriptions.</p>

<p class="p1">The stock dividend is a device frequently used to conceal actual
profits, or to cover up the fact that dividends are being declared in
excess of a fixed rate. This is especially true of such public service
corporations as lighting companies or street railways. In many cases
a company will go through the necessary formalities to increase its
capital stock for the purpose of absorbing surplus by means of a stock
dividend.</p>

<p><b>37. Treatment of a Loss.</b> If, during any year, the business has
sustained a loss, it will, of course, appear as a balance on the debit
side of profit and loss account. This will then be transferred to the
debit of undivided profits or surplus, if any, remaining from previous
years. For illustration, suppose the books show a surplus of $5,000.00,
undivided profits $500.00, loss for the current year $2,500.00,
the entry will be:&mdash;</p>

<table id="t74" summary="t74">

 <tr>
  <td>Undivided profits</td>
  <td class="tdr">$500.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Surplus</td>
  <td class="tdr">2,000.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdp2">Profit and loss</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">$2,500.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td colspan="3">Loss for the year.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">If there is no surplus remaining from former years, the business
is insolvent, in which case the capital is said to be impaired. This
can be taken care of in either of two ways. First&mdash;by the stockholders
subscribing to a fund to cover the deficiency. Second&mdash;by a
reduction of the capital stock.</p>

<p class="p1">The above would be a rather unusual proceeding as the
stock is fully paid, though such gifts are sometimes made. The
tendency of the present times is toward profit sharing for the
employes of corporations. The plan of profit sharing takes many
forms, and there are some notable examples among very large
corporations which have given employes stock in the corporation,
or afforded them an opportunity to acquire stock on very
favorable terms.</p>

<p>Among smaller corporations it is quite common to enable employes
to acquire its stock subject to certain special conditions.
Frequently employes are permitted to subscribe for stock with an
agreement that they are to pay no money, but that dividends declared
are to be applied to the payment of subscriptions. In this way the
stock is made to pay for itself out of its own earnings. Sometimes
provision is made for the payment of small annual installments on
the subscriptions in addition to applying the dividends. When
stock is issued to employes under these conditions, the contract sometimes
specifies that in the event of the subscriber leaving its employ
before the subscription is paid in full, the ownership of the stock
shall revert to the company, and in such cases the stock, until it becomes
full paid, is usually placed in the hands of a trustee. The
principal object in issuing stock to an employe and surrounding the
transaction with these restrictions is, of course, to insure his continuous
service by making it an object to him to remain in the employ of
the company.</p>

<p>When stock is so issued, the entry is&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq10 p1">Subscriptions</p>
<p class="pbq10i">Capital stock</p>
<p class="pbq10">Subscriptions to stock<br />

<p class="p1">Another provision sometimes met with in the issue of stock to
an employe is that in lieu of an increase in salary he shall receive, at
the end of the year, a certain amount in stock. He is then permitted
to subscribe for a stated amount of stock and to apply the bonus, or
added salary, as a payment. The bonus is usually a stated per cent of
sales or of net profits. When such a contingency arises the entry is&mdash;</p>

<p class="ph">RESERVES AND THEIR TREATMENT</p>

<p><b>44.</b> A reserve is an amount retained from current earnings to
meet a future contingency. According to a prominent authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
whose recent discussions of this subject have attracted attention,
<i>a reserve is an expression of the judgment of the accountant as to
what amount will be necessary to meet a contingency</i>. Reserves are
created for many purposes, among which the following are good
examples.</p>

<p><i>Reserves for bad debts.</i> An amount&mdash;usually a stated per cent
of accounts receivable&mdash;annually set aside to cover losses from uncollectable
accounts.</p>

<p><i>Reserves for depreciation.</i> The plant&mdash;buildings and machinery&mdash;will
wear out, no matter how substantially built. A charge is
made against current earnings to create a reserve which will provide
for a renewal of the plant, or any part of it, when worn out. Separate
reserves are usually maintained for buildings and machinery.</p>

<p><i>Reserves for Patents, Franchise, Goodwill</i> and similar fictitious
assets. An annual charge of an amount sufficient to extinguish the
value at which the fictitious asset has been placed on the books.</p>

<p><i>Reserves for permanent improvements on leased property.</i> Permanent
buildings, title to which will revert to the lessor at the expiration
of the lease, are sometimes erected on leased property. A reserve
is created to absorb the cost of such improvements during the life of
the lease.</p>

<p><i>Reserves for buildings in hazardous undertakings.</i> In certain
lines of business, manufacturing plants are erected with the expectation
of having a permanent supply of raw material. If the supply
gives out, the plant may be valueless for other purposes. Examples
are oil wells and mines. A reserve is created to absorb the cost.</p>

<p>The reserve is coming into more general use every year, especially
by corporations, whose managers see the necessity of providing for
these contingencies. When a machine wears out it must be replaced.
If no reserve has been created, the money for its replacement must
come from current earnings, or be provided by borrowing money or
increasing capital. The better plan is to make provision in advance
by creating a reserve.</p>

<p>The amount of the reserve should be the value of the asset, and
the sum set aside annually should be sufficient to equal the value of
the asset at the end of its estimated life. To illustrate, if a machine
is estimated to last 10 years, the annual reserve for depreciation
should be 10% of its cost. The reserve is carried on the books as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
a liability and is an off-set to the asset which it is to replace. If we
were to prepare a statement of the value of machinery as shown by
the books we would state it in this form&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">This shows the exact amount at which this asset is valued.
Taking the illustration referred to&mdash;at the end of 10 years the liability
<i>reserve for depreciation</i> will equal the asset <i>machinery</i>, and the funds
which have been reserved from profits during the past 10 years will be
available for the purchase of new machinery.</p>

<p><b>45. Reserve Funds.</b> A term frequently used to designate a
reserve created for a certain purpose is reserve fund. This term is
somewhat confusing for when we speak of a <i>fund</i> we are more likely to
think of it as an asset than as a liability. When the principle underlying
reserves is thoroughly understood, however, it is readily seen
that the use of the term <i>reserve fund</i> is merely a question of the use
of English and does not affect the principle. A reserve or <i>reserve fund</i>
is a nominal liability artificially created to off-set a decrease in value
of an asset. On the principle that an increase of liabilities represents
a loss, the amount reserved each year represents a loss, but since the
liability created is not a real but a nominal liability it does not affect
the real assets of the business.</p>

<p><b>46. Sinking Funds.</b> A sinking fund is an amount set aside
out of profits to meet an anticipated liability, or an obligation which
is to fall due at some future date. Sinking funds are set aside for
such purposes as the payment of bonds at maturity, mortgages, etc.
The sinking fund is the amount which, invested at compound interest,
will produce the desired amount at the end of the period.</p>

<p>A sinking fund is an asset and may or may not be withdrawn
from the business. Frequently a sinking fund is invested in securities,
such as government bonds, which are placed in the hands of a
trustee, thus insuring against the withdrawal of the funds from actual
use in the business.</p>

<p>Unlike a reserve, a sinking fund has no effect on the apparent
profits of the period in which it is created. It does, however, tie up or
render unavailable for dividends a certain part of those profits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Whether or not it is carried on the books in a separate account, a
sinking fund is a part of the surplus of a business.</p>

<p><b>47. Computing Sinking Funds.</b> The amount necessary to
set aside at the end of the year to provide a given sum in a stipulated
number of years at a stated rate of interest, compounded annually,
may be found as follows:</p>

<p>Divide the interest for one year upon the sum to be accumulated
by the compound interest upon $1.00 for the stipulated time. The
result will be the amount necessary to invest at the end of each year.</p>

<p>If the amount is to be invested at the beginning of the year,
divide the result obtained as above by the amount of $1.00 for one
year.</p>

<p><i>Example.</i> To provide for payment of $50,000.00 at the end
of 15 years, what amount must be put into a sinking fund at the end
of each year, if the fund is invested to earn 3% compound interest?
Interest on $50,000.00 for 1 year at 3% is $1,500.00. Compound
interest on $1.00 for 15 years at 3% is .55797. Dividing $1,500.00
by .55797 gives $2,688.32, the amount necessary to put into the fund
annually. If this amount is to be invested at the beginning of each
year, divide the above result ($2,688.32) by $1.03 (the amount of
$1.00 for one year at 3%) and we obtain $2,610.02 the amount needed.</p>

<p class="ph">BONDS</p>

<p><b>48.</b> In the sense here used a <i>bond</i> is the written obligation of a
corporation to pay a certain amount at a specified future date. Bonds
are usually secured by a mortgage on all or a part of the property of
the corporation.</p>

<p>A bond issue is a favorite method of borrowing money with
corporations. Bonds can be issued in any denomination, and by
reason of this a loan can be distributed among a large number of
investors. Being secured by mortgage on the company's property
the bonds of a corporation are very frequently more desirable investments
than its stocks. Interest on bonds must be paid before dividends
can be declared.</p>

<p>Bonds can only be issued with the consent of the holders of a
certain per cent of the stock.</p>

<p><b>49.</b> <i>Classes of Bonds.</i> The bonds of corporations are of several
classes, as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>A first mortgage bond is one secured by first mortgage on the
company's property.</p>

<p>A second mortgage bond is one secured by second mortgage.
Interest cannot be paid on second mortgage bonds until it has been
paid on the first mortgage bonds.</p>

<p>General mortgage bonds are those secured by a general mortgage
on all of the company's property.</p>

<p>Collateral bonds are secured by the deposit of collateral security.</p>

<p>A debenture is a bond with no other security than the good name
of the company.</p>

<p>Refunding bonds are those issued in place of maturing bonds
which the company does not wish to pay in cash.</p>

<p>Equipment bonds are those secured by the rolling stock of a
railway, and are also known as car trust certificates.</p>

<p>A gold bond is any form of bond, the terms of which specify that
it shall be paid in gold.</p>

<p>Registered bonds are those, the names of the owners of which
must be registered on the books of the company. Ownership of a
registered bond can be transferred only on the books of the company.</p>

<p><b>50. Bond Liability.</b> When bonds are issued by a corporation,
either public or private, an account is opened under some such caption
as <i>bond issue</i> or <i>bonds payable</i>. As fast as bonds are sold the proceeds
are credited to this account, which represents a liability. A new
account should be opened for each issue of bonds.</p>

<p>The bonds of a given issue will all bear the same date, with
interest payable from that date. We will suppose that a corporation
issues its bonds for $100,000.00 in denominations of $1,000.00 each.
These bonds are dated Feb. 1st, and bear interest at 5 per cent payable
annually. They are payable at the end of 10 years from date.
The company agrees to maintain a sinking fund of an amount sufficient
to pay the bonds at maturity if invested in securities drawing 4
per cent interest, and to invest the fund in such securities which are
to be placed in the hands of a trustee.</p>

<p>During the first year bonds are sold in the amounts and under the
conditions which follow:</p>

<p><i>First.</i> On the date of issue $10,000.00 of these bonds are sold
at par.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> At the end of three months $10,000.00 of the bonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
are sold at 101 and accrued interest, yielding $10,225.00 of which
$10,000.00 is principal, $100.00 premium, and $125.00 interest.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> The next sale is $10,000.00 of the bonds at 98, interest
accrued $250.00, yielding $10,050.00 made up of principal $10,000.00,
less discount $200.00, and interest $250.00.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p><b>51. Premium on Bonds.</b> When bonds are sold at a price above
par, the premium should be credited to a <i>premium on bonds</i> account.
When sold below par, the discount may be charged to the same
account.</p>

<p><b>52. Interest on Bonds.</b> The interest paid on bonds may be
charged to an <i>interest on bonds</i> account, which keeps it separate from
the regular interest account. When bonds are sold with accrued
interest, which is paid by the purchaser, the accrued interest is credited
to interest on bonds.</p>

<p><b>53. Expense of Bond Issue.</b> All expenses incurred in the issue
and sale of bonds should be charged to <i>expense of bond issue</i> account.
The account can be closed into profit and loss immediately, or it is
proper to spread it over the life of the bonds, charging off the proper
amount each year. It is also considered proper to charge discount
on bonds to this account.</p>

<p><b>54.</b> Continuing the example in Art. 50, we find that the amount
of bonds outstanding is $30,000.00, and a sinking fund must be
established which will equal this amount when the bonds mature.
Following the rule in Art. 38, we divide the interest on $30,000.00 for
one year at 4 per cent ($1,200.00) by the compound interest on $1.00
for 10 years at 4 = (.48024) obtaining as a result $2,498.75, the amount
necessary to be invested at the end of each year. This amount must
be provided each year for permanent investment to meet the principal
and an additional $1,500.00 must be provided each year for interest.</p>

<p>The entries which follow are the ones necessary to record the
sales shown in Art. 50.</p>

<p class="ph">MANUFACTURING AND COST ACCOUNTS</p>

<p><b>55.</b> Manufacturing began in this country many years ago and
was for a long time confined to the eastern and New England states.
Encouraged and fostered by national, state, and local governments,
and by discoveries of sources of supplies, it has extended to all parts
of the country. Manufacturing has grown to proportions which
place it at the very head of our industries, if we except agriculture,
the growth of which has been largely influenced by the progress in
manufactures. One result is that the business of manufacturing has
perhaps more than any other, attracted capital from great numbers
of investors, large and small. Owing to its very nature, manufacturing
readily lends itself to the corporate form of organization, and
it is for manufacturing that a very great number of corporations
have been formed. Manufacturing has, therefore, been selected for
a more complete exposition of corporation accounting.</p>

<p>The accounts of a manufacturing business are to a certain extent
peculiar to itself. Regardless of the nature of the product, there
are certain underlying principles which should govern the devising of
a system of accounts for a manufacturing business. Perhaps the
most important feature to be kept in mind is to so arrange the system
that the cost of manufacturing the goods will be shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Correct cost accounting methods are of greater importance to the
manufacturer than the method of keeping accounts with his customers.
He cannot afford to wait until the end of the year for results; he must
know what his goods cost him if he is to intelligently make selling
prices. There are so many opportunities for fluctuations in manufacturing
costs that the accounts must at least show approximate results
at all times.</p>

<p>Cost accounting is a profession in itself, and it is not our purpose
to discuss, in this paper, all of the details of collecting data in the
factory and shop. The purpose of this paper is to show the accounts
with which a bookkeeper for a manufacturing business should become
familiar. Even when a manufacturer does not maintain a complete
cost accounting system the bookkeeper can produce some valuable
statistics by a proper arrangement of the accounts.</p>

<p class="ph">ACCOUNTS USED</p>

<p><b>56.</b> For the purpose of illustration we have selected a representative
schedule of the accounts of a manufacturing business. The
following accounts are those which have a direct bearing on the
manufacturing branch of a business and do not include the administrative
and selling branches.</p>

<p class="ph">FACTORY ASSETS</p>

<p>1. <i>Real Estate.</i> Includes the cost of land and factory buildings.</p>

<p>2. <i>Machinery.</i> Charged with the cost of all machinery including
total cost of installation. Freight, cartage, and cost of erecting
the machine ready for use should be included.</p>

<p>3. <i>Patterns and Tools.</i> Charged through cash and purchase
book for all patterns and tools purchased. Charged through cash
book and journal&mdash;with proper credit to material and labor accounts&mdash;if
manufactured in the factory.</p>

<p>4. <i>Material Purchases.</i> Charged through purchase and cash
books for all purchases of material that enters into the product. Cost
includes charges for delivery. Credited for all material used in the
factory. This may be subdivided into several accounts to represent
the different classes of material used&mdash;as iron, steel, lumber, leather,
hardware, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>5. <i>Supplies Purchases.</i> Charged through purchase and cash
books for all purchases of factory supplies, like oil, waste, belt lacing,
and similar items. Credited for all supplies used in the factory.</p>

<p>6. <i>Finished Goods.</i> Charged for all goods finished, usually at
cost of manufacture. Sometimes a small factory profit is added.
This account represents a purchase account to the commercial department,
as it represents the cost of goods to them,</p>

<p class="ph">FACTORY EXPENSES</p>

<p>7. <i>Salaries.</i> Charged for salaries of superintendent, assistant
superintendent, and factory clerks.</p>

<p>8. <i>Labor.</i> Charged through cash and pay roll books for the
amount of all factory pay-rolls.</p>

<p>9. <i>Experimental.</i> Charged through cash and pay-roll books
and journal for all labor and material used in experimental work
carried on for the purpose of improving the product.</p>

<p>10. <i>General Factory Expense.</i> Charged through cash and
purchase books for cost of miscellaneous factory expense items not
otherwise accounted for.</p>

<p>11. <i>Power, Heat, and Light.</i> Charged for fuel, oils, water,
wages of engineer and firemen, electricity (when purchased), and all
other items entering into their cost.</p>

<p>12. <i>Building Maintenance and Repairs.</i> Charged through
cash and purchase books for materials purchased specially for repairs
to buildings. Charged through journal and pay-roll book for labor
and materials or supplies consumed in maintenance and repairs to
buildings.</p>

<p>13. <i>Repairs to Machinery.</i> Treated the same as No. 12.</p>

<p>14. <i>Repairs to Patterns and Tools.</i> Treated the same as No. 13.</p>

<p>15. <i>Insurance.</i> Charged through cash book for all premiums
paid for insurance on buildings and contents.</p>

<p>16. <i>Taxes.</i> Charged for all state, county, and city taxes.</p>

<p>17. <i>Depreciation of Buildings.</i> An amount charged off each
year to cover depreciation.</p>

<p>18. <i>Depreciation of Machinery.</i> Treated the same as No. 17.
Depreciation based on estimated life of machine.</p>

<p>19. <i>Depreciation of Patterns and Tools.</i> Treated the same as
No. 18.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p class="ph">SUMMARY ACCOUNTS</p>

<p>20. <i>Manufacturing Account.</i> Charged for cost of labor and
material consumed in manufacture of goods; charged for proper
proportion of all expense accounts; credited with cost of all finished
goods. Balance represents cost of all goods in process.</p>

<p class="ph">COLLECTING COST STATISTICS</p>

<p><b>57. Routine Followed.</b> The notes following the names of
the accounts in the above schedule explain their purpose and show
clearly how charges are made direct to the expense accounts. Further
explanations are necessary in regard to charges and credits to manufacturing
account.</p>

<p>Labor is easily disposed of as the amount standing to the debit
of labor account at the end of the month is transferred to the debit of
manufacturing account, closing labor account.</p>

<p>Material charges are more difficult to handle. In all well-regulated
factories all material is as carefully accounted for as cash.
Proper storage rooms are provided in which all material is stored.
These rooms are placed in charge of a man known as stockkeeper
or stores clerk, and no one is allowed to take material from the storerooms
without first presenting a written order, signed by the foreman,
showing for what purpose the material is to be used. This order is
retained by the stockkeeper and after he has posted the material to
his own records he sends it to the bookkeeper. From these orders,
the bookkeeper compiles a record of material withdrawn and, at the
end of the month, the amount is debited to manufacturing account
and credited to material purchases.</p>

<p>The stockkeeper keeps a record of all material received and
delivered and the balance of his accounts shows the quantities of the
different materials which he should have in stock. His record should
agree with the balance of material purchases account.</p>

<p>When a stockkeeper is not employed it is necessary to have
reports from the factory. The bookkeeper should arrange to obtain
daily reports from the foremen showing all materials taken into their
departments which are to be used in the manufacture of the regular
product. If any of this material is to be used for the manufacture of
tools or patterns for use in the factory, or for repairs to tools, patterns,
machinery, or buildings, it should be noted on the report with a statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of the exact purpose for which it is intended. From these
reports, the bookkeeper will compile his material records which will
be credited to material purchases, and charged to manufacturing
account and the different repair accounts at the end of the month.</p>

<p>Supplies are handled the same as materials, except that where
this is a small item it is sometimes treated as an expense account.
Where a considerable value is involved it is preferable to consider it
as a subdivision of the material account.</p>

<p>The expense accounts must be charged on a percentage basis
for the reason that the amounts actually expended vary in different
months, and an expense item paid in one month may cover that
particular expense for an entire year. Such items are insurance
premiums and taxes, paid once a year to cover twelve months. Other
expense items like experimental, power, and repairs are difficult
to determine for a single month. It is customary to base the charge
for these items on the records for the previous year. The amount of
such expenses for a year is divided by twelve and each month one
twelfth of the amount is charged to the manufacturing account and
credited to the expense account. If there is any discrepancy at the
end of the year it is adjusted by a debit or credit to finished goods.</p>

<p>Reports should be made daily by all foremen showing exactly
what partly finished goods are received in their department and the
quantity delivered to the next department. A record of these reports
should be kept, which will show at all times the quantity of goods in
process in each department. Reports of finished goods received in
the stock room will show the quantity manufactured, or rather
finished, during the month. See report form illustrated on page 53.</p>

<p>If all goods on which work had been started were finished, the
charges to manufacturing account would represent their exact cost,
but there is always a certain quantity of goods in various stages of
manufacture, and the amount already expended on them must be
considered. Therefore an inventory is taken of goods in process.
Great care must be exercised, in taking this inventory, that too high
a value is not placed on partly finished goods, for if the valuation is
too high the apparent cost of finished goods will be less than actual
cost. It is of utmost importance that the cost of manufacture be not
understated, for it is on this cost that selling prices will be based.
This is one reason why some manufacturers add a small-factory
profit. Unless a complete system of cost accounting is maintained,
this inventory of goods in process must be an estimate, but the record
of goods in process in each department will be of considerable assistance
in making the estimate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-270.jpg" width="400" height="657"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Daily Report of Work in Process</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>When the inventory is complete the amount should be deducted
from the total debits to manufacturing account, which will show the
cost of goods manufactured. This cost should then be credited to
manufacturing account and charged to finished goods account.
Manufacturing account will now show a debit balance representing
cost of goods in process.</p>

<p>This method will produce very satisfactory results for factories
in which but one line of goods is manufactured, but does not supply
the information required where several styles, sizes, or lines are made.
For one line of goods it is only necessary to divide the total cost by
the quantity produced, as pounds, feet, dozen, or gross to find the
cost of a single unit. In the more complicated business a detailed cost
system would be required.</p>

<p class="ph">PAY-ROLL RECORDS</p>

<p><b>58.</b> In connection with the labor account, the manner of keeping
the pay-roll record is of considerable importance. Like most other
forms of record, pay-roll books are made to suit the needs of the
individual concern. For a manufacturing business a feature to be
kept in mind is such an arrangement as will give the most complete
record of the cost of labor in each separate department. Where men
are never transferred from one department to another during a
weekly or monthly pay-roll period, this result would be obtained by
a simple grouping of the names by departments. In many manufacturing
lines, however, workmen are frequently transferred so that
to obtain costs for departments it is necessary to provide special forms
for distribution.</p>

<p>But why go to the trouble of distributing the pay-roll by departments?
That we may more closely watch expenses and costs. The
reports which the bookkeeper receives from foremen show quantities
of goods passing through each department. If the pay-roll is sectionalized
it will enable the bookkeeper to determine the labor cost
per unit of goods manufactured in each department. A comparison
of these costs from month to month will be of value in showing changes
in cost. The form illustrated provides for a business having four
departments and paying employes both on piece work and day wage
plans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p class="ph">EXPENSE INVENTORY</p>

<p><b>59.</b> When the books are closed, it usually happens that certain
expense accounts show expenditures for items of expense
that are not accrued. Illustrations are insurance and taxes paid
yearly in advance. Suppose insurance premiums to the amount of
$150.00 are paid on April 1st to cover insurance for one year. If
the books are closed July 1st, 9/12 of this amount will have been paid
for insurance that we have not received&mdash;the premium has not been
earned. The inventory will also show unused material which has
been charged to such expense accounts as repairs. It is proper to
take an inventory of these amounts, treating them as assets in the
balance sheet.</p>

<p>To properly record all such unearned expenses and make the
books agree with the balance sheet, an account should be opened
under the title of <i>Expense Inventory</i>, to which these items will be
charged, with corresponding credits to the proper expense accounts.
After the books have been closed, these items will be changed to the
expense accounts, and credited to expense inventory, closing the latter
account.</p>

<p class="ph">EXPENSE LIABILITY</p>

<p><b>60.</b> Certain expenses will have accrued which have not
been paid. Such an item is interest on bills payable, bonds, or
mortgages, or taxes due and unpaid. These items should be treated
as liabilities in the balance sheet. An account called <i>Expense
Accrued</i> should be opened and credited with these items, with corresponding
debits to expense accounts. When the books have been
closed, this account is closed by crediting the items to the expense
accounts from which they were received.</p>

<p class="ph">BALANCE LEDGER</p>

<p>61. A form of ledger now in quite common use is known as
the <i>balance ledger</i>. The form differs from the standard ledger
form in being provided with an extra column in the center in which
balances are extended. If the bookkeeper when posting, extends
the balance after each item is posted, much time is saved in looking
up accounts and in taking trial balances. The nature of the account
will usually indicate whether there is a debit or credit balance. Accounts
in the sales ledger will usually show a debit balance, while
one in the purchase ledger will have a credit balance. If the balance
is the opposite from what is to be expected it may be indicated by
placing the letter <i>D</i> in front of the amount in the balance column for
debits, or the letter <i>C</i> after the amount for credits.</p>

<p class="ph">SAMPLE TRANSACTIONS</p>

<p>62. The following transactions exhibit the accounts which
are special to a manufacturing business without including the commercial
accounts which record sales. The manner of keeping those
accounts is the same for a manufacturing business as for any other.</p>

<p>Being a business conducted by a corporation these accounts include
the stock accounts usually kept in the general books. The
auxiliary stock books are omitted, it being felt that the special illustrations
of such books will have been sufficient to give the student a
thorough understanding of their uses.</p>

<p>The books required in the manufacturing business, omitting
sales accounts, are <i>invoice register</i> or <i>purchase book</i>, <i>cash book</i>,
<i>journal</i>, <i>pay-roll distribution book</i>, <i>purchase ledger</i>, and <i>general ledger</i>.</p>

<p class="p1">We will now close the ledger to ascertain manufacturing results
for the month, by making the following adjusting entries in the
journal&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">Debit Manufacturing Account</p>
<p class="pbq10">for material issued to factory.</p>
<p class="pbqn">Debit Building Maintenance and Repairs</p>
<p class="pbq10">for material used in repairs.</p>
<p class="pbqn">Credit Material Purchases</p>
<p class="pbq10">for both of the above.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>
<p class="pbqn">Debit Manufacturing Account</p>
<p class="pbqn">for Labor Account</p>
<p class="pbqai">for Supplies used&mdash;found by deducting inventory from supplies purchases.</p>
<p class="pbq10">for Salaries Account<br />
for Rent one month<br />
for Power, Heat, and Light&mdash;found as above<br />
for Building Repairs<br />
for Office Supplies&mdash;found as above<br />
Credit accounts representing above<br />
for amounts charged.</p>

<p class="p1">The manufacturing account will now show, on the debit side
the total manufacturing expense for the month. The next step
is to find the cost of finished goods to be credited to manufacturing
account and charged to finished goods account. Our inventory of
goods in process, which includes material and labor only, amounts
to $1,002.00. The labor account and reports from foremen show
that the amount of these items used in the factory is $1,672.30. In
round numbers, the former is 60% of the latter, that is, sixty per
cent of the work started is still in process. We will assume, therefore,
that this is a fair percentage to be used in determining the expense
items invested in goods in process. Taking 60% of the total manufacturing
expense gives $1,400.13, which, deducted from the total,
leaves $933.42 as the cost of finished goods.</p>

<p>In this case the per cent of goods in process is large for the
reason that it is the first month of operation. The results in succeeding
months will be more nearly equal. If the factory is running
regularly, turning out practically the same quantities each month,
the quantity of finished goods will just about equal the work started
in any one month.</p>

<p>Should we wish to show a factory profit of 10%, it will be necessary
to add 10% to the cost of finished goods which will then represent
the cost to be used by the sales end of the business. Since we
have no account to which this amount can properly be credited, we
will open a new account called <i>contingent profits</i>, which will be closed
into profit and loss at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Since we are not closing the books for the purpose of making a
balance sheet, we do not close the expense accounts into an expense
inventory account as explained in article 59. Instead, the balances
are allowed to stand until such time as the books are finally closed.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE VOUCHER SYSTEM AND ACCOUNTING CHARTS</h2>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="ph">VOUCHER SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTING</p>

<p>1. <i>Voucher.</i> A document which vouches the truth of accounts.</p>

<p><i>Receipt.</i> An acknowledgment of money paid.</p>

<p>The voucher system is sometimes referred to as a modern system
of accounting, but a study of the above standard definitions indicates
that it is modern only in respect to forms of records and routine.</p>

<p>In the nomenclature of accounting the term voucher is quite
commonly used in the same sense as the term receipt. The only
distinction appears to be that a voucher is usually understood to be
an acknowledgment of the payment of a particular item on account,
while a receipt may be an acknowledgment of the payment of money
without reference to the item or items covered.</p>

<p>Since the transaction of business began receipts or vouchers in
some form have undoubtedly been used. Some form of acknowledgment
of money paid has always occupied a place in business.
But at first, receipts were not required&mdash;they were incidental; given
as a matter of courtesy; a "thank you" in written form.</p>

<p>When the first man, after paying his grocery bill, was forced
to pay it a second time because the merchant had failed to mark his
account "paid," he <i>demanded</i> a receipt. He learned then and there
that accounts, and those who keep them, are not infallible. He
told his neighbors, and the custom of demanding receipts for money
paid, came into being.</p>

<p>The receipt was demanded as a matter of self-protection, to
prevent the possibility of payment of an amount being successfully
demanded a second time. But the receipt was not an integral part
of the accounting records of a business; it might or might not be
demanded without affecting the records. So long as business was
conducted by single proprietors or small partnerships, this was satisfactory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
since the receipt was not required as a record between
partners.</p>

<p>With the advent of joint-stock companies and corporations,
came ownership by a large number of investors. Having their
capital invested, these owners had a right to know what was being
done with their property, and there came a demand for a more strict
accounting of money and property entrusted to the care of the managers
of the business.</p>

<p>As business expanded and corporations grew in size and power,
with wider spheres of activity, it became necessary to divide the
operations of business concerns into departments, with corresponding
divisions of authority. This meant the creation of a central authority
to whom an accounting must be made by the departments or branches.</p>

<p>Audits were introduced. Not only did stockholders want to
know that the business was honestly conducted, but the managers
demanded proof that property entrusted to subordinates was accounted
for and that the accounts were accurate&mdash;that is, truthful.
Not satisfied with the evidence offered by entries in account
books, auditors asked for further proof of the payments recorded;
they demanded receipts, <i>vouchers</i>.</p>

<p>The voucher as used in modern accounting practice is then something
more than a receipt for the payment of money; it is a proof
that property has been administered as claimed by the accounting
records. "A document which vouches the truth of accounts,"</p>

<p><b>2. Use of Vouchers.</b> The most general use of the voucher still
is as an acknowledgment of the payment of money. In fact, when
we speak of a voucher it is usually understood to mean a receipt or
acknowledgment of the payment of money for a specific purpose.</p>

<p>A voucher states the exact purpose for which the money is paid,
the items either being listed or reference made to a specific invoice
or account. Then when receipted it becomes a voucher in fact and
takes its place as an integral part of the accounting records. The
voucher may be said to form a connecting link, furnishing proof that
the money was expended as shown in the records and that it was
received by the payee. In this respect it acts as a check against a
misappropriation of funds.</p>

<p>As the system of vouchers for payment of money came into
more general use, many accountants argued that it should be carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
still further. Sales records were vouchered by original orders,
shipping receipts, and invoice copies, and purchases by the regular
vouchers, but there was no voucher for transactions involving transfers
of values from one account to another. In making journal
entries involving such transfers, many opportunities for fraud were
opened. Just such entries have been frequently used to cover up
fraudulent transactions.</p>

<p>The logical step to make the voucher system complete in every
detail was the introduction of the journal voucher. If a voucher is
provided for each journal entry, the bookkeeper can produce authority
for every transaction recorded in his books.</p>

<p>The journal voucher is a voucher of authority, that is, it authorizes
the entry involved and must be signed by an officer having power
to make such authorization. To the bookkeeper, it is in many cases
a protection, for if a question arises as to the legality of a transaction,
he can produce his authority for the entry, which will place the responsibility
where it belongs.</p>

<p>We have come in contact with cases in which the bookkeeper,
following the explicit instructions of an officer of a company, has
made entries clearly intended to defraud either creditors or stockholders,
only to be later made the "scapegoat" and held jointly responsible
with his superior officer.</p>

<p>Not all such entries show their clear intent, though their real
purpose be fraudulent. Some of them are so ingenuous and supported
by such plausible explanations, that the bookkeeper has no suspicion
of their real nature. A case in point: a corporation was
organized in a small town to engage in a manufacturing enterprise.
Like many another corporation of similar character, the benefits
which would accrue to the town, were dwelt upon at length by
the promoters, and citizens were induced to invest their savings in
small blocks of stock. Also, like many another enterprise entered
into and managed by men with no technical training,
this little factory struggled along for a few years, always operated at
a loss. But a change came; an experienced manager was secured
and the business began to exhibit symptoms of a healthy growth.
The second year showed a profit; almost enough to wipe out the deficit.
The third year the business outgrew the capacity of the plant,
and $20,000.00 was invested in new machinery. Not an old machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
was discarded. The manager instructed the bookkeeper to charge
$15,000.00 of the amount to repairs, explaining that it would off-set
the amount which should have been charged off as depreciation in
former years. Perhaps,&mdash;but it made the books show a small loss
instead of a substantial profit for the year. And it is significant that
several holders of stock, worth face value, and more, sold their
holdings to the manager at an average price of .65. If no profit
could be made on such a volume of business as had been transacted
that year, what hope for the future?</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 1. Voucher to be Receipted and Returned</p>
</div></div>

<p>To what extent a bookkeeper is justified in presuming to conserve
the morals of his employer, is not a subject for present discussion.
Just where the line should be drawn between moral and
legal responsibility, is sometimes difficult to determine. But that
bookkeeper innocently assisted in robbing unsuspecting stockholders.
Had he insisted on the signed authority of the manager&mdash;that is,
demanded a voucher&mdash;the entry might never have been made;
he, at least, would have been freed from any possible charge of complicity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p><b>3. Forms of Vouchers.</b> The essential feature of a voucher is
that it must show clearly the purpose for which it is drawn, and provide
a proper form of receipt. There are many forms of vouchers
designed to meet the requirements of different businesses.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-302.jpg" width="400" height="473"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 2. Back of Voucher Showing Distribution</p>
</div></div>

<p>The most simple form of voucher is a statement of items paid,
with a receipt to be signed by the payee. A remittance in the form
of cash or a check accompanies the voucher, the receipted voucher
being returned by the payee. A form of voucher of this class is
shown in Fig. 1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>The items paid can be listed on the voucher, or there may be a
reference to certain invoices included in the payment. Some accountants
attach the original invoice to the voucher, but for certain
reasons we do not advocate this practice. Until the receipted voucher
is returned there is no record of the items covered, unless the invoice
has been copied.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-303.jpg" width="400" height="454"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 3. Combined Voucher and Check Used by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company</p>
</div></div>

<p>Some houses are slow in returning receipted invoices, resulting in
many annoying delays. If the invoice is kept on file we at least have
a record of the transaction, and it may be very necessary to refer to
the invoice for prices or other information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>The back of the voucher is usually printed with a form for a distribution
of the amount to the account or accounts to which it should
be charged. A typical form is shown in Fig. 2. For permanent filing
a voucher of this style is folded so that the number appears at the
top, followed by the name of the payee, and the distribution record.</p>

<p><b>4. Voucher Checks.</b> A step in advance of the early form of
voucher with separate check is the voucher check. This is a form
which combines the voucher and check.</p>

<p>Of voucher checks there are many forms, each designed to
meet some special condition, or to conform with the ideas of the
accountant. While these forms exhibit many variations in detail
they may be divided into two general classes: folded voucher
checks and single voucher checks.</p>

<p>The folded voucher check is usually twice the width of an ordinary
check, making it regular check size when folded. This is
intended to provide a receipt for the payment of items listed, by the
endorsement of the check. Several such forms are illustrated.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 is a form of combined voucher and check used by the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company, The account is transcribed on
<i>A</i>, this being a sheet twice the width of a check. This form is
made in duplicate, <i>B</i> being the carbon copy which is filed as a
record of authority for the issuance of the voucher. The check
itself, shown in <i>C</i>, is written on the back of the original voucher. <i>A</i>.
When folded, this form is the size of a regular check and goes through
the bank in the usual manner. The endorsement of the payee is
a receipt in full for the items covered by the voucher.</p>

<p>This is a representative form of the folded voucher check. Naturally
the details recorded will vary in different businesses, but the
general plan is subject to slight changes. Some objection is raised by
banks to the folded form. The claim is made that considerable inconvenience
is caused in handling in the bank, by checks slipping
between the folds.</p>

<p>Many of the earlier forms of voucher checks were not checks
until certain conditions had been complied with. On the face of the
voucher was printed "when properly receipted this voucher will be
paid through ... Bank."  This required a receipt in some
special place, instead of the usual endorsement of a check, and it was
not always easy to tell, at a glance, the amount to be paid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Very naturally, objections were raised by the banks against the
use of these complicated forms, but forms have been simplified in
ways that have largely overcome these objections.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-305a.jpg" width="400" height="141"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 4. Form of Voucher Check that Requires no Folding</p>
</div></div>

<p>An improvement is the ordinary check form arranged to provide
a valid receipt for stated items. Such a form is illustrated in Fig. 4.
This is an ordinary check form of regulation size, on which is noted
the item or items paid. The checks are put up in pads and numbered
as used. When endorsed, the check provides a valid receipt for the
items covered.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 6. Voucher Distribution<br /> Sheet</p>
</div></div>

<p>A voucher check with some advantageous features is shown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Fig. 5. This is made in
duplicate. <i>A</i> is the original
voucher check, while <i>B</i> is
the duplicate. When sent
out, the stub shown in <i>B</i>,
a duplicate of the statement
on the original check, is attached
to the check. This
is detached by the payee for
his records, and enables him
to deposit the check without
waiting to make the entry in
his cash book.</p>

<p>These voucher checks
are made in sheets and
punched for filing in a loose-leaf
binder. The balance of
the form shown in <i>B</i>, the
part remaining after the
check and duplicate statement
have been removed,
is a copy of the check, and
remains in the binder.</p>

<p>The checks are numbered
consecutively, but the
voucher number is entered
when used and corresponds
with the number of the
voucher paid.</p>

<p>The office record of the
items paid is made on the
voucher form shown in Fig.
6. These are numbered
consecutively, in the order
in which they are approved,
and when paid are filed in
numerical sequence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Another style of loose-sheet voucher check is illustrated in Fig. 7.
This form is made on the typewriter, in triplicate, and includes the
original check, a receipt and a copy of the check. The forms are
made two to a sheet, and when a check is to be written the triplicate
sheet is placed in the machine, three copies being made at one writing.</p>

<p>The triplicate form, or copy of the check, is the permanent record
from which posting is done. Both the check and receipt are mailed
and the payee is expected to return the receipt. If not returned within
a reasonable time, the payee is followed up by letter and asked to return
the receipt, as this becomes a part of the permanent office records.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 8. Duplicate Voucher with Check Attached</p>
</div></div>

<p>An excellent form of voucher with check attached is shown in
Fig. 8. The voucher is made in duplicate, the check being attached
to the original. The duplicate is kept on file for the office record,
while the original, with check attached, is mailed to the vendor. He
detaches the check and deposits it, keeping the original statement in
his files. In the event of discrepancies, the vendor is expected to
return both voucher and check, endorsement being considered as a
receipt in full for items included in the statement.</p>

<p><b>5. Journal Vouchers.</b> As previously explained, a journal
voucher is a properly signed authorization of a journal entry. Journal
vouchers are not intended to be used for the ordinary journal entries of
a business, as closing entries and ordinary adjusting entries. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
are more particularly intended for special credit items or allowances,
and special transfer or adjusting entries.</p>

<p>Fig. 9 illustrates a convenient form of journal voucher. This
form is intended to be filed in a loose-leaf binder, and when so filed,
becomes the journal itself, posting being made direct to ledger accounts.
The usual method, however, is to make the entry in the
journal and file this voucher as an evidence of authority.</p>

<p>A journal voucher should require the final approval of some one
man before it becomes valid. The head of a business can keep in
touch with all special allowances by having the journal vouchers
brought to him for his signature.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-311.jpg" width="400" height="269"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 9. Journal Voucher for Adjusting Entries</p>
</div></div>

<p>One reason for the use of journal vouchers in large establishments
having several departments is that special credits and allowances
are constantly coming up, with which only one department
manager is familiar. His O. K. is obtained, and the voucher must be
approved by the manager, which makes these men responsible for
the transaction.</p>

<p><b>6. The Voucher Register.</b> Though the form of voucher is of
considerable importance, and should be designed to meet the requirements
of the business, the keystone of the voucher system of
accounting is the voucher register. Wherever used, the voucher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
register possesses certain uniform characteristics, but in each business
the form takes on special features; in fact, the voucher register is distinctively
a special form.</p>

<p>The voucher register is really a form of purchase book, with
other features added, and takes the place of these records. In addition
to the usual features of the purchase book or invoice register,
the voucher register furnishes a complete record of payment of bills,
and shows at all times the net amount of Accounts Payable. Another
most important feature is that it exhibits all expenditures, for
whatever purpose. A voucher is provided and properly registered for
every check issued, insuring a receipt in proper form for every dollar
paid out.</p>

<p>When properly handled, the voucher system does away with the
purchase ledger, no ledger accounts with creditors being necessary.
The register in connection with a file of unpaid vouchers, furnished a
complete record of each individual creditor's account. At the same
time, a controlling account is provided, which exhibits the total of
outstanding accounts, and balances with the voucher register.</p>

<p>To furnish representative illustrations, we show several forms of
voucher registers, which exhibit the special features usually found in
such records. These may be used as guides in designing registers for
any business.</p>

<p>Figs. 10 and 11 show forms identical in general arrangement,
except that one is designed for a mercantile business, while the other
is intended for a manufacturing establishment. The columns beginning
at the extreme left are as follows: <i>Date Entered</i>, <i>Voucher
Number</i>, <i>Name of Payee</i> and nature of account, <i>Date of Invoice</i>,
<i>Vouchers Payable</i> (the total), and <i>Date Due</i>. The columns following
are for distribution of the total to the different accounts. Columns
are provided for those accounts in each group to which most frequent
charges are made. The amounts of the vouchers are extended in
these columns and footings carried forward to the end of the month.</p>

<p>In every business there are certain expense accounts to which
charges are infrequent, not more than one charge a month, and in
some cases one or two in a year. Examples of these accounts are
insurance, taxes, rent, etc. To add columns to an already large
voucher register for the accommodation of these few items is impractical,
hence the Sundries column is provided for charges to accounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
for which special columns are not provided. Space is allowed for
entering the names of the accounts, and each item is posted direct
to the ledger account.</p>

<p>The form of voucher register illustrated in Fig. 12 is designed for
use where a complete voucher system, including the use of journal
vouchers, is maintained. The special feature of this form is the
addition of several columns for credit accounts. Space is provided
for entering the names of the accounts to be credited, the amounts
being carried to the proper ledger columns. This makes it possible
to enter any journal voucher, and since full particulars are shown
in the voucher itself, no explanations are required in the register.</p>

<p>At the right of these forms are columns for recording particulars
of settlement. A column headed <i>Unpaid Vouchers</i> will also be noted.
On the last day of the month, when all items have been entered, the
amounts of all unpaid vouchers are extended in this column, and the
total is carried forward to the next month's sheet, where it is entered
in the <i>vouchers payable</i> column. When these vouchers are paid,
particulars of payment are entered on the sheets containing the
original record; as would have been done if they were paid in the
month in which they were entered.</p>

<p>The footings of all columns are carried forward to the end of the
month, when the totals of all distribution columns, excepting sundries,
are posted to the debit of the corresponding ledger accounts.
The footing of the <i>vouchers payable</i> column, less unpaid amount
brought forward, must agree with the total footings of all distribution
columns, since it represents the total of all vouchers registered.
The net amount, that is, the footing of the <i>vouchers payable</i> column,
less the amount of unpaid vouchers brought forward, is posted to the
credit of a vouchers payable account.</p>

<p>On the credit side of the cash book, two columns headed <i>Vouchers
Payable</i> are provided for the entry of payments. One column is
headed Discount and the other <i>Amount of Check</i>, the discount column
being a memorandum only. At the end of the month the total of
these columns is posted to the debit of the vouchers payable account,
the controlling account of the voucher register. When the footing
of <i>unpaid vouchers</i> is brought forward at the end of the month, it
should agree with the balance of the vouchers payable account.</p>

<p>Another method of handling unpaid vouchers is to provide both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
<i>debit</i> and <i>credit</i> columns on the voucher register, headed <i>Suspense
Accounts</i>, as shown in Fig. 13. All unpaid vouchers are carried to
the credit column at the end of the month, and when paid the entry
is made in the debit column. Footings of the suspense columns are
carried forward in pencil, for, when all amounts on one sheet have
been paid, those items need not be considered in obtaining the balance.
One advantage claimed for this method is that it keeps the <i>vouchers
payable</i> column free of all but current items.</p>

<p>Another feature of this form, Fig. 13, is the absence of a check
number in the <i>payment</i> column. In this case, a voucher check is
used, which necessitates but one series of numbers. When bills
are audited, the voucher checks are made out and numbered, but the
dates are omitted until payment is made, when they are entered with
other particulars under the head of <i>Payments</i>.</p>

<p>An objection is sometimes made that with the voucher system,
allowing but one line to an invoice, no provision is made for partial
payments. This can be easily overcome with this form of register.
Any unpaid balance of a current item will be carried to the <i>suspense</i>
column. If further partial payments are likely to be made, the
amount should be entered in the <i>credit</i> column and the name of the
payee in the <i>remarks</i> column. Several lines should then be allowed
for the account, permitting the entry of as many separate payments.</p>

<p>When all bills are paid as soon as audited, taking advantage of
cash discounts, there is no necessity for columns intended to care for
suspense items. All vouchers will be paid not later than during
the month next following the date of entry, and there will be no unpaid
vouchers not found on the current or next preceding month's
record.</p>

<p><b>7. Operation of Voucher System.</b> While accountants have
introduced many details into the operation of the voucher system, all
intended to make the application of the system more nearly perfect
in some particular business, the general routine of conducting the
system is summed up in the following:</p>

<p class="pbq10 p1">
1. Auditing of invoices.<br />
2. Executing and registering vouchers.<br />
3. Filing audited vouchers.<br />
4. Paying vouchers.<br />
5. Filing paid vouchers.<br />
6. Indexing paid vouchers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1"><b>8. Auditing of Invoices.</b> When invoices are received they
should immediately go to the purchasing agent. If there is no
regularly appointed purchasing agent, or in a business like a department
store where there are several buyers, the invoices should be
kept by the auditor, comptroller, or chief accountant until the
goods are received, when he will obtain the O. K. of the person who
ordered the goods or incurred the obligation.</p>

<p>Pending the receipt of the goods, the invoices should be filed
alphabetically, under the name of the vendor. The file may be one
of the flat files which can be kept on the desk or if the number of
invoices be large, a section of a vertical file drawer can be used.</p>

<p>When the goods have been received, which will be attested by a
report in some form by the receiving clerk, the invoice is O. K.'d for
quantities and prices by the buyer, and extensions are checked by the
auditor or chief accountant.</p>

<p><b>9. Executing and Registering Vouchers.</b> As soon as the invoices
are audited, vouchers are executed and entered in the invoice
register.  Extensions are made to the proper columns, placing
the accounts on the books, just as would be done if invoices were
credited to accounts of the vendors in the general or purchase ledgers.</p>

<p>Vouchers should never be made for invoices in dispute, as to
prices or on account of claims for shortage, damaged goods or other
cause. Until such claims are adjusted, the invoices should be kept in
a file reserved for items in suspense. When the books are closed, such
items must be included under liabilities in the balance sheet. To
avoid actually entering them on the books, they may be entered in the
balance sheet under some such caption as "<i>Suspense Accounts</i>."</p>

<p><b>10. Filing Audited Vouchers.</b> The vouchers are now ready
for filing until date of payment. This does not apply if invoices are
always paid as soon as audited, but in the majority of business houses
at least a part of the vouchers will not be paid until the last due date;
or if discounts are taken, they will be paid on the last discount date.</p>

<p>Some provision must be made for bringing these vouchers to
notice on the date at which they should be paid. For this purpose, a
"tickler" or date file is used. This consists of a file with an index of 31
numbered index sheets, intended to represent the days of the month,
and sometimes a set of twelve index sheets printed with the names of
the months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>The audited vouchers are filed under the date when payment
is to be made, either the discount date or the last due date, by
placing them back of the index sheet bearing the corresponding
number. To illustrate; if an invoice is dated the 2nd of the month,
and terms are 2/10, the last discount day will be the 12th, and the
voucher will be filed back of the No. 12 index sheet. If payment
is due in a subsequent month, the voucher is filed back of the
corresponding monthly index, then on the first of the month these
vouchers are distributed under the proper dates.</p>

<p><b>11. Paying Vouchers.</b> Each day the vouchers filed back of
that day's index are removed from the file for attention. If for any
reason they are not to be paid that day, they should be filed under the
next date when it is desired to bring them to notice. It may be well
to note at this point that the vouchers and invoices are usually filed
together in the date file.</p>

<p>The check is now written and entered in the cash book or the
check register, attached to the voucher, and mailed. Or if a voucher
check is used it is only necessary to date and enter. These payments
are posted from the cash book to the voucher register. It is not a
safe plan to enter the voucher check direct in the voucher register, as
postings to the cash book are liable to be overlooked. Payments in
one day may be recorded on widely separated pages of the voucher
register, while in the cash book or check register they would be entered
consecutively, making posting much less difficult.</p>

<p>When the voucher and check have been mailed the invoices are
placed in a temporary file, indexed alphabetically, where they are
kept until the return of the receipted voucher. It will be noted that
we do not advocate mailing the original invoice with the voucher.
This temporary file is examined from time to time, and if any vouchers
have been out an unreasonable length of time, the vendors are asked to
sign and return them, or sign duplicates sent for the purpose.</p>

<p>When the voucher check is used, the temporary file for invoices
is not required. The checks, if cashed, must be returned through
the bank, and the invoices can be filed permanently.</p>

<p><b>12. Filing Paid Vouchers.</b> On the return of the voucher,
properly receipted, the invoices which it pays are removed from the
temporary file, when all are ready for permanent filing.</p>

<p>The invoices are permanently filed in an alphabetically indexed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
file, under the names of the vendors, keeping all invoices from each
firm together. At some time before filing, preferably when the
voucher is executed, the voucher number should be entered on the
invoice, and when several invoices are paid by one check, they should
be fastened together with a staple or other suitable device.</p>

<p>The paid vouchers should be filed in numerical sequence, with
indexes numbered by 100's and 20's to separate them and to assist
in locating any desired number. If we want to find voucher No. 964,
we turn to the index 900, constituting the main division, then to
index 60, back of which the desired voucher will be quickly located.
A file should be procured of suitable size to accommodate the voucher
to be filed.</p>

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 14. Card Index of Vouchers Paid</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>13. Indexing Vouchers.</b> With the permanent filing of the paid
voucher the transaction is closed, with one exception. There must
be another index to the voucher file. Knowing the number, we can
quickly locate any voucher or find its record on the register, but if
we want to locate the voucher paid to Jackson &amp; Co.&mdash;without knowing
the number&mdash;we have no guide.</p>

<p>Reference to the original invoices, filed alphabetically, on which
the numbers are noted, will locate the voucher, but there are vouchers
for which no invoices are on file. To locate these by name of payee,
an alphabetical index is necessary, and it is advisable to include all
vouchers even when invoices are on file.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>For this purpose, a card index is recommended, and a suitable
form is shown in Fig. 14. A card is used for each person or firm to
whom vouchers are issued, and all vouchers are listed by date and
number. The cards are filed alphabetically, making it easy to find
any name.</p>

<p><b>14. Voucher File.</b> The manner of filing and indexing invoices
and vouchers, from the receipt of the invoices to the permanent
filing of the paid voucher, has been explained. For the file itself, the
vertical file is recommended.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-320.jpg" width="400" height="197"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 15. File Showing Method of Indexing Vouchers</p>
</div></div>

<p>Fig. 15 illustrates one drawer of a vertical file, subdivided with
the different indexes required, showing how in a small business a
single drawer can be made to answer all purposes.</p>

<p>In a large business several drawers would be required. The
first drawer would be for pending invoices, where would be filed
invoices for which shipments have not been received. The second
drawer would contain audited vouchers held for payment, and suspense
items; the latter including invoices held for adjustment of
claims. Paid invoices and paid vouchers would each require a
separate drawer.</p>

<p>Files should be selected with reference to the size of the papers
to be filed. Manufacturers of such equipment now supply cabinets
in sections, in a great variety of sizes, making it possible to build up
a filing cabinet with drawers to fit every paper of standard size.</p>

<p class="ph">UNIT SYSTEM OF VOUCHER ACCOUNTING</p>

<p><b>16.</b> In all classes of accounting records, the unit system is
rapidly gaining in popularity. The unit system, so called, consists
of individual records of each transaction or each item recorded, instead
of a combination of several transactions in one record.</p>

<p>The increase in the use of the unit system has been brought
about very largely by the improvements in typewriters, which make it
possible to produce several copies of a given document at one writing.
An example of the application of the unit idea is seen in modern sales
records, where duplicate invoices are made, one copy serving as a
sales sheet and posting medium.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-327.jpg" width="400" height="260"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">A VIEW IN THE GENERAL OFFICES OF THE S. OBERMAYER CO., CINCINNATI, OHIO</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>The unit system has been very successfully applied to voucher
accounting, saving much time and resulting in very complete records.
Compared with ordinary voucher systems, the most prominent feature
of the unit system is a method of distribution by filing, rather than by
means of a voucher register.</p>

<p>All vouchers are made on the typewriter, in manifold, one or more
copies being used for record purposes only. The original is used
exactly as described in the preceding pages.</p>

<p>An essential feature of the system is that a copy of the voucher
is provided for each account to which it is to be distributed. When
one account only is involved, the voucher is made in duplicate, but if
the amount is to be distributed to two accounts an extra copy is required.
The voucher should be so arranged that the distribution
can be shown on the face of the duplicate and triplicate copies.</p>

<p>The duplicate voucher is filed according to its distribution, instead
of recording the amount in the voucher register. A vertical
file is used for this purpose. The index cards are headed with the
names of the accounts, and are arranged in the order of the accounts
in the ledger; this being the order in which the same accounts would
be arranged in a voucher register. Back of each index is a folder
in which the vouchers are filed.</p>

<p>Each voucher copy is filed in the folder representing its proper
account, and is securely fastened to the folder with a staple or paper
fastener. When this voucher is filed it is also recorded on the outside
of the folder, which is printed as shown in Fig. 18.</p>

<p>This form is designed for a record of amounts, distributed under
the proper monthly headings. The amount of each voucher is carried
to the current month's column. At the end of the month, the footing
of the column shows the amount to be charged to that particular
account in the general ledger.</p>

<p>To arrive at the total of vouchers payable account, a recapitulation
sheet, ruled as shown in Fig. 19, is used. This is an index card, and is
placed in the front of the file. Totals of all account folders are entered
in the proper columns of this sheet, at the end of each month. Payments
are posted to this sheet at the end of the month, from the cash
book, and the balance extended. This balance, of course, represents
the unpaid vouchers and is checked against the unpaid voucher file.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>The totals of the different account columns are posted to their
respective accounts in the general ledgers, either directly from the
recapitulation sheet, or through the journal. The recapitulation
sheet, as here shown, is a transcript of the vouchers payable account,
and might be used as a ledger card, but it is generally considered
better practice to carry the account in the general or private ledger, as
usual.</p>

<p>Such a voucher system furnishes a complete record, with much
less transcribing of items, than is involved in the use of the voucher
register. The copy of the voucher is made at the same writing as
the original, the amount of each individual voucher is entered but
once, on the account folder, and monthly totals, only, are carried
to the distribution columns on the recapitulation card.</p>

<p>This system is equally well adapted to the loose-leaf method. A
sheet is used for each account, behind which the vouchers are filed,
and a monthly recapitulation sheet is provided for distribution.</p>

<p class="ph">COMBINED PURCHASE LEDGER AND INVOICE FILE</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Not every business readily adapts itself to a complete
voucher system. Special conditions sometimes arise which make
it seem advisable to keep ledger accounts with all firms from whom the
business is making purchases. A case in point is a business, lacking
capital to pay all bills promptly, necessitating payments on account,
or by note, instead of payments covering certain invoices in
full.</p>

<p>To obviate the difficulties, in maintaining a complete voucher
record, under these and similar conditions, many substitutes have been
devised. As an example of what may be accomplished in this direction,
we illustrate a system which is in successful operation in a manufacturing
business.</p>

<p>In the ledger, the usual nominal accounts are kept but no purchase
or voucher register is used. Columns are provided on the credit side
of the cash book for such expense accounts as are usually paid in cash,
that is, for which no invoices are rendered, and for accounts payable.</p>

<p>For the purchase accounts with firms and individuals, a vertical
file is used. Each creditor is assigned a folder, on the front of which
a suitable record form is printed. This form is shown in Fig. 20.
The name and address are written at the top, and the ledger account
is kept in the columns at the extreme left of the form. All of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
columns for distribution are left blank, it being seldom that purchases
from one firm are distributed to more than a half dozen different
accounts.</p>

<p>When an invoice has been O. K.'d it is immediately filed in the
proper folder. The total is entered in the credit column and distributed
to the proper accounts, the names of which are written at
the head of the distribution columns. Payments on account are
posted to these ledger accounts from the cash book.</p>

<p>If the distribution is properly made, the totals of all distribution
columns will agree with the total of the credit column. At the end of
the month the total of these distribution columns on the individual account
folders are drawn off on the monthly recapitulation sheet illustrated
by Fig. 21. The totals shown by the recapitulation are posted
to the debit of the corresponding ledger accounts, while the grand
total is posted to the credit of accounts payable account;&mdash;which is
the controlling account of the purchase ledger. Totals of payments
on account are posted to the controlling account from the cash book.</p>

<p>The proof of accuracy of the controlling account is found in the
usual way, by checking against the balances of the individual purchase
accounts.</p>

<p>With this system, invoices are filed, and the amounts posted, with
practically one operation. The items which make up each ledger
account are distributed as soon as posted, totals only being carried to
the recapitulation sheet, from whence they reach the ledger.</p>

<p>Accounts are quickly located, as the folders are indexed alphabetically.
When an account is balanced it must be left in its place
until the end of the month, provided credits have been entered in the
current month, so that totals of distribution will be carried to the
recapitulation sheet. At the end of the month, all accounts which
balance may be transferred to a section of the file reserved for closed
accounts. Should any of these accounts again become active, they
are transferred to the regular file without the slightest confusion.</p>

<p>For the purpose of saving time, the balances of all open accounts
may be drawn off when the totals of the distribution columns are obtained.</p>

<p>While not recommended for general adoption this system has
its points of merit, and in certain contingencies would undoubtedly
prove very satisfactory. The main reason for its publication in this
work is to show the possibilities of modifying a system, in respect
to details, without destroying its more important features. The
voucher feature, the obtaining of a formal receipt for every payment,
can be maintained just as effectively with this system as with a
more formal voucher system.</p>

<p class="ph">THE PRIVATE LEDGER</p>

<p><b>18.</b> A ledger, devised to contain such accounts as the principals
of a business desire to keep from the knowledge of the bookkeeper
or other office employes, is known as a private ledger. The title
is also frequently used to designate an ordinary general ledger.</p>

<p>The accounts most frequently found in the private ledger are
Capital accounts, Profit and Loss, Reserves, Surplus, Bills Payable,
Bonds and Mortgages Payable, and Controlling accounts with the
general or personal ledgers. It may also contain such accounts as
Salaries of Officers, or Partners, Investment and Drawing accounts,
and accounts with real or nominal assets. If it is desired to keep from
the employes, knowledge of the exact nature of any transaction, or
the standing of a particular account, it can be done by making use of
the private ledger.</p>

<p>When both ledgers are used, the private ledger contains only those
accounts which it is desired to keep <i>private</i>, while the general ledger is
kept for all other accounts, except those included in the personal ledgers.</p>

<p>The private ledger is most commonly used in large businesses
where, for various reasons, a number of employes have access to the
books, and it is desired to keep them in ignorance of the private affairs
of the concern. The private ledger is usually kept by one of the partners,
an officer, the auditor, or the chief accountant.</p>

<p><b>19. Advantages of Private Ledger.</b> The primary advantage of
the private ledger to the principals of a business, is that by its use, they
can keep to themselves all details of transactions of a special nature.</p>

<p>Some other advantages that accrue to the principal may be
enumerated as follows:</p>

<p>He can, through the private ledger, keep an eye on the activities
and condition of the business as a whole, or of any particular department
or branch of that business.</p>

<p>He can keep in touch with the liabilities, or with the total amount
of personal accounts outstanding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>He can absolutely control the distribution of expense in manufacturing
operations.</p>

<p>He can keep from his employes, knowledge of the profits or losses
of the business.</p>

<p>Partners can keep private the amount of their investments, or
the salaries drawn.</p>

<p>Salaries paid to individual officers or employes can be kept
private.</p>

<p>Dividends declared, capital subscribed, investments of a special
nature, or amount of assets of any kind, can all be kept from the knowledge
of employes.</p>

<p><b>20. How Operated.</b> Accounts in the private ledger must not
conflict with accounts in general or personal ledgers, and the fact that
private accounts are kept should not interfere with the balance of the
general books. To insure against any such conflict, a private ledger
controlling account is kept in the general ledger.</p>

<p>In the general cash book, and sometimes in the journal, debit
and credit columns headed <i>Private Ledger</i> are provided. All entries
affecting private ledger accounts are extended in these columns, but
no particulars are recorded. At the end of the month, the totals of
these columns are posted to a private ledger account in the general
ledger. This controlling account then appears in the general ledger
trial balance, and must agree with the balance of accounts in the
private ledger.</p>

<p>With the private ledger a private journal is used, in which entries
affecting private ledger accounts are made, with explanations in
detail.</p>

<p>As an example of the use of the private ledger we will suppose
that a payment of $500.00 is to be made to a certain party, and it is
desired to keep that transaction private. The bookkeeper is instructed
to draw a check for the amount, to be charged to private
ledger account. He enters the check in the general cash book, debiting
private ledger and crediting cash or bank. The entry is posted
from the general cash book to the private journal, where full
particulars are recorded, from which it is posted to the private
ledger. In the case referred to, the amount of the check is debited
to the proper nominal account, and credited to a general ledger account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>The general ledger account in the private ledger is a controlling
account which agrees with the private ledger account in the general
ledger. Only entries affecting general ledger accounts are posted to
this account. Entries involving changes in private ledger accounts
only, are made in the private journal direct.</p>

<p>Some concerns keep the controlling accounts with the sales and
purchase ledgers in the private ledger. At the end of the month, total
debits and credits to accounts in these ledgers are entered in the private
journal. These totals are obtained from the general cash book,
sales book, purchase book, and any other books from which postings
are regularly made.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 22. Cash Book with Columns for Private Ledger Accounts</p>
</div></div>

<p>When a private ledger is kept, it precludes the possibility of
forced balances in the general ledger trial balance, since the balances
of the private ledger accounts must agree with the private ledger controlling
account in the general ledger, and if sales and purchase ledger
controlling accounts are kept in the private ledger, these must
balance with the personal accounts in those ledgers. The use of
a private ledger not only acts as a check on trial balance errors,
but simplifies the trial balance by making possible a proof of ledgers
in sections.</p>

<p>Fig. 22 is an illustration of a cash book with columns for the
private ledger account.</p>

<p><b>21. Manufacturing Accounts in the Private Ledger.</b> Not infrequently,
manufacturers find it advisable to keep private certain
details which affect costs, or even all knowledge of the exact cost of
their manufactured product. This may be done by keeping certain
manufacturing controlling accounts in the private ledger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>In determining the cost of manufacture of any class of goods,
three elements enter into the computation; material, labor, and expense.
To determine the cost of the first two items is comparatively
simple, requiring only an efficient system of records in
the factory. But to determine the amount of expense of all classes,
included in the cost of a given article, job, or operation, is more
difficult.</p>

<p>A system of records that will show the exact cost of such items as
power, heat, or taxes properly chargeable to an individual job or
operation is obviously impossible, and it has been found necessary to
apportion these, and all similar items of expense, on a percentage basis.
Usually this percentage is based on some element of cost which can be
determined with accuracy.</p>

<p>Cost accountants and engineers have worked out this percentage
on the basis of various elements of cost, as direct labor, material, machine
hour, man hour, or a combination of two or more of these elements.
The exact method used, which must be adapted to the conditions
existing in the individual factory, does not enter into this discussion.</p>

<p>Since there are numerous items of expense of the character
referred to, it is customary to group them, for purposes
of cost computation. Sometimes all such expense items are
grouped under the one head of General Expense. It is by means
of a controlling account in the private ledger, that the distribution
of expense is made, thereby keeping private the exact cost of
manufacture.</p>

<p>The known cost of a certain job or article&mdash;the cost of material
and labor&mdash;is frequently referred to as the prime cost. The duties of
the cost clerk may end with determining the prime cost, his computations
not including expense items.</p>

<p>The total cost of material and labor for the month is charged to
private ledger account, material and labor accounts receiving proper
credit. The exact amounts of the various items of expense for the
month are also charged to private ledger account, with credits to
expense accounts.</p>

<p>In the private journal, these items are charged to various controlling
accounts, and credited to the general ledger controlling account.
The usual entries are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<table id="ta0" summary="ta0">

</table>

<p class="p1">The percentage of expense for the current month on whatever
element based, has been determined from the actual results of
the preceding month. To illustrate, we will suppose that expense
is apportioned on the basis of direct labor; the cost of this item during
the month was $1,600.00, and the amount of expense charged to
operation of the plant during the same period was $240.00;&mdash;which
gives us a ratio of 15%.</p>

<p>We wish to determine the cost of jobs as they are completed
during the current month. The records turned in by the cost
department give us the actual cost of material and direct labor, but
not knowing the exact ratio of expense to direct labor for this month,
we use last month's ratio, and add an amount equal to 15% of the
known cost of direct labor. When the actual results for the month
are determined it is quite probable that the ratio will vary from last
month's record, as either factor may change. It will be necessary
to adjust this difference, which is the reason for an expense distribution
or expense adjustment account in the private ledger.</p>

<p>By keeping the expense controlling account in the private ledger,
the principal can keep private, not only the actual cost of an article,
but the percentage of expense and the basis of the expense apportionment.
If thought desirable, he can add further amounts for the
purpose of establishing a selling price.</p>

<p>In actual operation, the amount of expense to be charged against
completed work will be computed, and the following entry made:</p>

<table id="ta1" summary="ta1">

 <tr>
  <td>Manufacturing Account</td>
  <td class="tdr">$______</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdp2">Expense Distribution</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">$______</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>The amount of expense charged to jobs completed.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">If the expense ratio used were exact, the expense distribution account
would balance at the end of each month, but owing to the fluctuations,
a balance will remain. This is adjusted by increasing or decreasing
the percentage used during the following month, and in this way the
accounts are kept in balance.</p>

<p>Manufacturing account has been charged with labor, material,
and expense,&mdash;the total manufacturing cost. Completed goods are
charged to a finished goods account, the entry being:</p>

<table id="ta2" summary="ta2">

 <tr>
  <td>Finished Goods</td>
  <td class="tdr">$______</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdp2">Manufacturing Account</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">$______</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Net cost of goods completed</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">But manufacturing account will not balance, for there always will be
work in process, and the balance of the account will be the cost to
date of this work in process, a most important record.</p>

<p>This discussion is not intended to cover every possible use of the
private ledger, but, by means of examples, to suggest its possibilities.
The explanations and examples should afford the student many hints
of value.</p>

<p class="ph">CHARTING THE ACCOUNTS</p>

<p><b>22.</b> The proper arrangement of the accounts of a business is
best shown by a chart, in which the accounts to be kept are grouped
according to their relative importance. In laying out a chart of accounts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
they should be first separated into their proper divisions.
The natural divisions are capital, trading, and profit and loss.</p>

<p>Each division contains only those accounts that naturally belong
in that particular class. These divisions are then subdivided into
groups containing specific kinds of accounts, the groups being arranged
in logical sequence. As an example, the trading division
of a manufacturing business is divided into manufacturing and
trading. There may be several subdivisions of the manufacturing
account; several classes of goods may be manufactured and a manufacturing
account kept for each class, or it may be necessary to manufacture
completed parts, each requiring a complete manufacturing
process. Detailed costs being required for each of these completed
parts, manufacturing accounts are kept for each, the main division
representing the cost of the finished product, as a result of the assembling
of the parts. The completed parts are treated as raw material,
when drawn for use in the finished product, the total costs being
finally absorbed by the main manufacturing account. One of the
many examples that might be cited is a packing business, operating
its own can factory and keeping a manufacturing account to show the
cost of cans. Other accounts show the cost of the product packed
in those cans, and both costs are absorbed in the cost of the commodity
as marketed.</p>

<p>The trading account is similarly subdivided. In a department
store, the manager of a department may receive a certain percentage
of the profits of his department. This necessitates trading accounts for
each department. A mercantile concern may operate branch stores
and keep trading accounts with each, on the books of the main office;
a factory may produce several lines of goods, with a corresponding
subdivision of trading accounts.</p>

<p>A chart of accounts not only furnishes a guide to the bookkeeper,
but presents in the most logical form, the natural divisions of the business.
It is both a working guide and a mirror of the accounting
records.</p>

<p><b>23. Chart of Small Trading Business.</b> The most simple chart
of accounts is one for a small trading business conducted by a single
proprietor. Following is a chart of the accounts of such a business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-340.jpg" width="400" height="394"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 23. Chart of Profit and Loss Accounts</p>
</div></div>

<p>A study of this chart will disclose the reasons for the general
grouping of the accounts. The first general group, capital accounts
is subdivided into assets and liabilities. The assets are grouped in
the order of their availability; the order in which they can most
readily be converted into cash. The liabilities are grouped according
to the security; unsecured, secured and capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>There being but one trading account, it is represented by a
single group, purchases and in-freight representing the cost of goods,
and sales the gross proceeds. The balance of this account exhibits
the gross profits.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-341.jpg" width="400" height="397"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 24. Chart of Profit and Loss Accounts</p>
</div></div>

<p>We now come to the profit and loss account by which the trading
or gross profits are absorbed. This group contains, first, the revenue
producing accounts not represented in the trading account; second,
the revenue expenditures or expense accounts. The outer brackets
of the chart group all of the accounts under <i>Debit</i> and <i>Credit</i>. This
shows that the balances of the accounts are debit or credit as the case
may be.</p>

<p>We have traced the profits to the profit and loss account, but in
closing the books they will finally be absorbed by the proprietor's
capital account. The chart, Fig. 23, traces the profits from trading
to proprietor's account. In the trading account, the gross profit
completes the balance. This profit is now absorbed by the profit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
loss account. Net profit completes the balance of profit and loss account,
and is, in turn, absorbed by the proprietor's account. Here,
the net profit added to previous investment, equals the present
worth. The chart, Fig. 24, also traces profits to the proprietor's account.</p>

<p><b>24. Chart of Manufacturing Accounts.</b> A chart of the accounts
of a manufacturing business follows similar lines to that of a trading
business, the only change being the addition of the accounts of the
manufacturing group. The accounts of this group will depend both
upon the nature of the business and the extent to which the details of
operation are recorded.</p>

<p>A chart of the accounts of a harness and saddlery manufacturing
business is given herein. This business is divided into three departments;
harness, collar, and saddlery.</p>

<p>A record of the gross profits, resulting from the operation of each
department, being desired, we have three manufacturing and three
trading accounts.</p>

<p>The chart shows the accounts classified to exhibit detailed
operations of each department. The number of accounts in this
chart is 98. This is rather more than is required in the average
business of this character, but the chart furnishes a good illustration
of the possibility of segregating accounts of various classes.</p>

<p>Even so large a number of accounts, with the minute subdivisions
here shown, does not present the difficulties that might appear at first
glance. The principal requirement is a thorough knowledge of the
items entering into each account; the actual keeping of the accounts
is a matter of close attention to these details. When an elaborate
chart of accounts is laid out, it should be accompanied by detailed
explanations and instructions. Some large concerns issue printed
instructions which are given to all officers and employes who may
be called upon to determine, to what account an item should be
charged.</p>

<p>The illustrations (pp. 48-50) show how all of these accounts are
assembled into main groups, and finally closed into profit and loss,
and capital accounts. An explanation of the accounts in the harness
department will be sufficient to show how all of the accounts are
treated.</p>

<p>Harness manufacturing, account <i>A</i>, is charged with accounts
34 to 39, inclusive, and the proper portion of account <i>D</i>. It is credited
with the cost of all finished goods, the amount being transferred to
account <i>E</i>, harness trading. It is credited with the increase in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
inventories over the preceding month, this amount being transferred
to account 40; if inventories show a decrease, the amount is charged.</p>

<p>Harness trading, account <i>E</i>, is charged with cost of finished
goods from account <i>A</i>; with account 64; with gross profits, transferred
to profit and loss, account <i>H</i>. It is credited with sales, account 63;
with increase in inventory, account 65.</p>

<p>Gross profits on account of trading are closed into profit and loss.</p>

<p>Inventory adjustment accounts Nos. 40 and 65, are still open
and the balances show total inventories. The actual amounts of
inventories are transferred to accounts 4 to 7, inclusive. This will
leave a balance in inventory adjustment account No. 40, representing
work in process in the harness factory. These inventory adjustment
accounts are closed only at the end of the fiscal year, or when the
books are closed. At the beginning of a new fiscal period the inventories
are again charged to inventory adjustment accounts, and adjusting
entries made monthly in manufacturing and trading accounts.</p>
